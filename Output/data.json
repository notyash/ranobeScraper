        "Chapter: 7": "The idea hit Lumian like a bolt of lightning, but he didn't particularly fancy going through with it.\n\nIgnoring the fact that years had flown by since the Warlock's demise and that the lifespan of owls was measly compared to humans, the sheer number of birds in the mountain was enough to make Lumian reconsider.\n\nThere were too many of the damn things!\n\nThat owl doesn't have any distinct markings\u2026 No, in the legends, there was no mention of anything specific about the owl. Naroka didn't disclose everything\u2026 We didn't inquire deeply enough... He snapped out of his thoughts and flashed a reassuring smile at Reimund.\n\n\"An owl tied to a Warlock could live for a hundred years.\" \n\nAs Reimund trembled with fear, he reassured him in a calm voice, \"Don't fret, mon ami. This is my last resort. I do not wish to encounter a monster.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we should consult another old sage. Naroka may have overlooked a vital clue.\"\n\nThe man's tone turned seductive as he continued, \"If I were a Warlock, I would not keep all my treasures with me or in my home. I would stash some away in case the Inquisition attacked me. I would not have the luxury of time to collect my belongings. When I must flee, I would be left destitute.\"\n\nThe Inquisition of the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun was notorious for hunting down Warlocks and Witches. Their \"heroic deeds\" were celebrated throughout the countryside.\n\nReimund's face lit up with excitement as he exclaimed, \"You are right!\"\n\nHe said with a yearning expression, \"It's a shame. Too many years have elapsed. The Church's discovered riches must have been spent ages ago.\"\n\n\"Mon ami, that's a dangerous thought,\" Lumian teased.\n\nUndeterred, they continued their visits to Pierre-p\u00e8re, Naferia, and other elders of the Maury family.\n\nAlthough their responses mirrored Naroka's, Lumian and Reimund, with their newfound experience, managed to extract more details.\n\nFor instance, the owl was of medium size and resembled its kind. It had a pointed beak, a feline face, brown feathers with scattered spots, brownish-yellow eyes, and black pupils\u2026\n\nHowever, it was larger than the average owl, and its eyes appeared to spin. It was not as rigid or dim-witted as its kind.\n\nAll these peculiarities made the owl seem even more sinister in their descriptions.\n\n\"Seems like we've hit a dead end,\" Lumian stated to Reimund as they traveled to the townsquare. \"We must focus on other legends.\"\n\nReimund was not as discouraged as he had been earlier. \"Agreed. But which one should we pursue?\"\n\nThis fellow is so proactive and hardworking\u2026 Lumian silently praised Reimund's enthusiasm and diligence and readied a reward for him.\n\nHe nodded and said, \"Take your time and reflect on it. We shall discuss tomorrow. I shall impart combat techniques to you this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Marvelous!\" Reimund exclaimed, overjoyed by the unforeseen instruction.\n\nAurore was a skilled fighter. After all, how else could she handle the savage and rough men in the village? Her younger brother was likely to be just as proficient.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to Reimund Greg, Lumian veered onto the trail leading to his home.\n\nAs he walked, he spotted a group of men approaching him.\n\nThe leader was in his prime, not towering above 1.7 meters in height. He wore a white robe and had light black hair.\n\nWith a regal demeanor and decent facial features, the tip of his nose curled slightly in undisguised disgust and malice as he glared at Lumian with his blue eyes.\n\nNone other than the padre of the Eternal Blazing Sun Church in Cordu, Guillaume B\u00e9net.\n\n\"I have been awaiting your arrival for quite some time,\" Guillaume B\u00e9net bellowed in a baritone voice. \"Did you deliberately bring those foreigners to the cathedral?\"\n\nLumian attempted to explain himself as he furtively took a step back. \"I thought you were sleeping inside.\"\n\nHe had noticed Pons B\u00e9net\u2014the padre's younger sibling\u2014standing beside Guillaume B\u00e9net. Pons was in his early thirties, muscular, domineering, and a bully. \n\nThe other individuals with them were the padre's henchmen.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net signaled Pons with a glance as Lumian retreated.\n\nPons B\u00e9net's grin turned sinister as he lunged forward, bellowing, \n\n\"Rascal, eet ees time zat you learn who ees ze father here!\"\n\nBefore he could complete his sentence, Pons had already hastened his steps and pounced on Lumian. The other brutes followed suit.\n\nIn Cordu, a place where logic held no sway and apologies fell on deaf ears, brute force was the only language that could command respect. Guillaume B\u00e9net, the padre, knew this all too well, having resorted to violence countless times before. So, when he learned that the outsiders had been ushered into the cathedral by Lumian, the priest wasted no time in making his move. He was determined to get hold of the ruffian and pummel him into submission until he lay bedridden for a month. The padre was keen to show Lumian the error of his ways and wouldn't rest until someone paid the price for his insolence.\n\nOf course, he had to avoid Aurore.\n\nRegarding the law, he only needed to notify the administrator and the territory judge, B\u00e9ost. The city sheriffs were unlikely to investigate such a minor issue in the countryside.\n\nAs an outsider, B\u00e9ost would not offend a local-born padre unless there was significant conflict of interest.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net felt fortunate that the foreigners had not divulged his affair with Madame Pualis, the administrator's wife, to anyone. He was still unaware of this.\n\nDespite their speed, Lumian was quicker. Just as Pons spoke, Lumian pivoted and dashed away.\n\nHe was familiar with the padre's character and methods.\n\nPreviously, a villager had accused Guillaume B\u00e9net of having multiple mistresses and embezzling offerings from the Eternal Blazing Sun. He had also bullied others relentlessly in the village, hardly behaving like a man of the cloth. Subsequently, the villager had mysteriously died one afternoon.\n\nThud thud thud!\n\nLumian raced like the wind.\n\n\"Wait for your papa, eh? Attends ton p\u00e8re!\" Pons shouted while chasing him. His pace was not sluggish either.\n\nThe thugs pursued closely behind him.\n\nInstead of fleeing along the main road, Lumian darted into the nearest house.\n\nThe family was preparing lunch in the kitchen when they suddenly saw a stranger burst in.\n\nWith a swoosh, Lumian darted past them and leaped out of the kitchen window at the back.\n\nBy the time Pons and his cronies entered, the homeowner had regained his senses. He stood up to confront them and inquired, \"What is going on? What are all of you doing?\"\n\n\"Get out of ze way, old man!\" Pons shoved the homeowner aside with force, but it slowed him down.\n\nWhen they reached the window and jumped out, Lumian had already vanished into another trail.\n\nAfter pursuing him for a while, they lost sight of Lumian entirely.\n\n\"Sacrebleu, ces chiens fous!\" Pons spat on the roadside.\n\n...\n\nOutside the semi-subterranean two-story abode, Lumian gasped for breath before finally opening the door and entering the house as though nothing had happened.\n\n\"One, two, three, four; two, two, three, four\u2026\" A series of rhythmic shouts reverberated in his ears.\n\nLumian gazed at the empty space on the other side of the kitchen and observed Aurore's blond hair tied in a ponytail. She wore a flaxen shirt, tight white pants, and dark sheepskin boots, leaping around and drenched in sweat.\n\nIn Cordu, the kitchen occupied most of the space on the first floor, serving as the family's core. Cooking and dining occurred here, as did receiving guests.\n\nShe's exercising again\u2026 Lumian was accustomed to Aurore's eccentricities and was unfazed by her exercise regimen.\n\nAurore often did strange things without giving any reason when probed.\n\nAt the very least, exercising is beneficial, and it's quite a feast for the eyes\u2026 Lumian observed silently.\n\nAfter a while, Aurore stopped and squatted to turn off the black tape recorder. \n\nShe took the white towel from Lumian and instructed him as she wiped the sweat from her forehead, \n\n\"Remember, we have combat practice this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I have to study and learn combat. Aren't you demanding too much of me?\" Lumian grumbled nonchalantly.\n\nAurore glanced at him, smiling, and retorted, \"You must remember that our objective is the comprehensive development of the five educations<span tabindex=\"1\">1 of morality, intellect, physique, aesthetics, and labor!\"\n\nThe more she spoke, the happier she became, as if recollecting something beautiful or amusing.\n\nI have already failed moral education\u2026 Lumian muttered under his breath.\n\nHe queried, \"What kind of combat?\"\n\nOne of the things he failed to comprehend was that Aurore, who seemed delicate and frail, was an expert in combat. She mastered numerous fighting techniques and could easily overpower him.\n\nAurore pondered seriously, leaned forward slightly, and gazed into Lumian's eyes.\n\nShe then laughed heartily and declared, \"Self-defense!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Lumian exclaimed in astonishment. \"Isn't that supposed to be for girls?\"\n\nAurore stood tall and shook her head gravely, saying sincerely, \"Boys must protect themselves when they are out. Who says boys don't encounter perverts?\"\n\nThe smile on her lips was no longer hidden.\n\nLumian was unsure if his sister was joking or serious, so he remained silent as he retrieved the white towel and headed towards the stairs.\n\nSuddenly, he felt something tighten under his foot, as if he had tripped over an obstacle. He stumbled forward.\n\nIn midair, Lumian hastily contracted his abs, extended his arm, and leaned on the chair beside him. He somersaulted and barely landed on his feet.\n\nAurore retracted her leg and chuckled.\n\n\"One of the fundamental combat principles is to be vigilant at all times. One cannot be complacent. \n\n\"Remember that, my novice brother?\"\n\nHer right hand had already clutched Lumian's back, but when she saw that he had regained control of his body, she let go.\n\n\"It's because I trust you too much\u2026\" Lumian grumbled.\n\nHe contemplated the matter and realized that this trust was meaningless. He had lost count of how many times he had been at the mercy of Aurore.\n\nAurore coughed and restrained her expression.\n\n\"How did it go with that woman?\"\n\nLumian provided a brief summary of their conversation before declaring, \"I intend to wait for your friends to respond before delving into the dream.\"\n\n\"Smart decision,\" Aurore affirmed.\n\nLumian changed the subject. \n\n\"What's for lunch?\"\n\n\"We still have some leftover toast from this morning. I'll roast four more lamb chops for you,\" Aurore replied after contemplating for a moment.\n\n\"What about you?\" Lumian inquired.\n\nAurore casually said, \"I'll just have truffle bamboo chicken shreds topped with some cheese and onion soup. I tried it last time and found it to be quite\u2026\"\n\nBefore she could finish speaking, she suddenly froze.\n\nThe next moment, she raised her hands to cover her ears. The muscles on her face gradually contorted, making her appear somewhat ferocious.\n\nLumian observed silently, his eyes filled with anxiety and apprehension.\n\nAfter a while, Aurore exhaled deeply and returned to her usual self.\n\nHer forehead was drenched in sweat once more.\n\n\"What happened?\" Lumian asked.\n\nAurore smiled and responded, \"The ringing in my ears is acting up again. You know that I have this old problem.\"\n\nLumian didn't probe further. Instead, he said, \"Alright, then I'll prepare lunch. Rest well.\"\n\nEvery time this occurred, his yearning for extraordinary abilities grew stronger, as it became a pressing matter.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 5": "Kirsch. As expected of someone from a big city\u2026 Lumian's gaze eventually landed on the glass in the lady's hand.\n\nThe distilled spirit made from sugar and fermented cherries had a color and texture that appealed to the ladies. Of course, they could replace the cherries with other fruits, but it would alter the taste only slightly.\n\nCordu's Ol' Tavern had a limited stock of high-grade wine, including Kirsch, which Madame Pualis fell in love with during her visit to the provincial capital, Bigorre. \n\nMadame Pualis was the wife of B\u00e9ost, the local administrator and territorial judge. Her noble ancestors had lost their title during Emperor Roselle's reign. \n\nLumian knew that she was also one of the mistresses of the padre, Guillaume B\u00e9net, but not many people in the village knew about it.\n\nLumian shifted his gaze away from the lady and walked towards the bar counter. \n\nA man in his forties wearing a linen shirt and trousers of the same color was sitting there. His brown hair was no longer lush, and his face was creased from years of hard labor.\n\nHe was none other than Pierre Greg, Reimund's father.\n\nAnother Pierre.\n\nAt least a third of the people at the bar would answer to the call of Pierre, Lumian had joked earlier in front of Leah, Ryan, and the others.\n\nIn the village, when people talked about Pierre or Guillaume, they had to specify which family they were referring to. \n\nMany families had fathers and children with the same names, making it impossible to tell them apart without adding \"p\u00e8re,\" \"a\u00een\u00e9,\" or \"junior\" to their names.\n\nReimund sauntered up to his father's side and asked, \"Papa, why don't you go to the square and chat with the others?\"\n\nThe men in the village always convened under the ancient elm tree or in someone's abode, where they'd spend the day playing dice, cards, chess, and swapping all sorts of rumors\u2014the tavern cost money, after all.\n\nPierre Greg, with a glass of rich red wine in hand, turned to his second son and said, \"We'll go later. There shouldn't be many people at the square now.\"\n\nThat's right. Where did all the men in the village go? Lumian was immediately perplexed.\n\nHe had noticed the absence of the village men at the square.\n\n\"Monsieur, I want to ask you something,\" Lumian said bluntly.\n\nPierre Greg immediately turned alert.\n\n\"A new prank?\"\n\nThe story of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" does indeed have a basis in reality\u2026 Lumian turned his head, gesturing for Reimund to speak.\n\nReimund hesitated for a moment, gathering his thoughts. \n\n\"Papa, how long ago did the Warlock legend you told me happen? The one where it took nine bulls to pull the coffin.\"\n\nPierre Greg gulped down a mouthful of wine, his brow furrowed in puzzlement. \n\n\"Why are you asking this?\n\n\"You know, your p\u00e9p\u00e9 told me this when I was just a wee lad,\" Reimund replied.\n\nThe Riston Province, where Cordu was located, and the neighboring provinces of Aulay and Suhit were located in the south of the Intis Republic. They were famous grape producers, and the wine here, especially the inferior ones, was very cheap. In some years, people could even drink wine like water.\n\nReimund was disappointed because it had been a long time since his grandfather had passed on.\n\nSuddenly, Pierre Greg chimed in, \"Your p\u00e9p\u00e9 claimed that he saw it with his own two eyes when he was but a young man. It spooked him so much that he became deathly afraid of owls. He was convinced that their evil talons could snatch his very soul away.\"\n\nLumian and Reimund's eyes sparked with excitement, almost in unison.\n\nMerde, there were actual clues!\n\nThe legend of the Warlock\u2014it was something that someone had actually experienced?\n\n\"Did P\u00e9p\u00e9 mention anything about where the Warlock lived or where he was buried?\" Reimund asked eagerly.\n\nPierre Greg shrugged. \"Who cares?\"\n\nNot one to be deterred, Reimund persisted, determined to glean any shred of information. Before he could speak, Lumian intervened with a gentle touch on his shoulder as he spoke loudly, \"The river awaits us.\"\n\nReimund was just about to take his leave with Lumian when Pierre Greg suddenly remembered something.\n\n\"Hold up, Reimund. You'll soon be a Greenwatcher, won't you? There's something you need to be aware of.\n\nGreenwatchers had the crucial responsibility of patrolling the highland pastures around the village and nearby fields to prevent any illegal grazing during the prohibited period or livestock from ravaging the saplings.\n\nLumian didn't pay much heed to the conversation and made his way to the tavern's washroom.\n\nAs he exited the restroom, he took a detour to the female foreigner who was sipping on Kirsch. It was impossible to discern her age.\n\nAlthough he had no intentions of striking up a conversation, he observed her with great detail. It might come in handy in the future, just like how he had used Ryan, Leah, and Valentine to infiltrate the padre's scandalous scene.\n\nAfter a few subtle glances, Lumian was poised to head for the entrance of the tavern to wait for Reimund when the languid lady in the orange dress looked up.\n\nBefore Lumian could retract his gaze, his eyes met hers.\n\nLumian felt a little awkward as his thick skin couldn't protect him from the unexpected encounter.\n\nMany thoughts immediately surfaced in his mind.\n\nMaybe I should take a cue from the padre and administrators of the Church and praise her beauty? Or perhaps I should switch gears and hit on her? Alternatively, should I show my inexperience and hastily turn around to leave?\n\nAs Lumian made up his mind, the lady interrupted his thoughts and said with a smile, \"Been having dreams, have you?\" \n\nLumian was hit by a bolt of lightning. His thoughts went numb and his mind froze.\n\nAfter a moment or two, he managed to force a smile and asked, \"Dreaming isn't unusual, is it?\"\n\nThe woman touched her cheek with one hand and sized Lumian up. She chuckled and said, \"Lost in a misty dream, perhaps?\"\n\nHow could she know? Lumian's pupils dilated instantly, and his expression betrayed a hint of fear.\n\nDespite having experienced many things, he was still young, and for a moment, he couldn't control his emotions.\n\nStay calm, Lumian. Stay calm\u2026 He repeated to himself, trying to relax the muscles on his face, before asking, \"Did you hear the tale I told those three foreigners last night?\"\n\nThe woman didn't reply. Instead, she pulled out a stack of cards from her orange purse, which sat on the chair next to her.\n\nShe cast her gaze at Lumian once again and broke into a radiant smile.\n\n\"Draw a card. Perhaps it can aid you in unlocking the hidden secrets of that dream.\"\n\nWh\u2014 Lumian was taken aback, his guard instantly raised.\n\nHe was both enticed and wary.\n\nHe looked down at the card she presented him and furrowed his brows.\n\n\"Tarot?\"\n\nThe card resembled the tarot cards created by Emperor Roselle for divination.\n\nThe woman looked down sheepishly and offered a self-deprecating smile.\n\n\"My apologies, I must have grabbed the wrong one.\"\n\nShe swiftly returned the 22 tarot cards to her medium-sized handbag and pulled out a different deck.\n\n\"This is also tarot, but it's from the Minor Arcana. You don't have the privilege to draw from the Major Arcana pack, and I don't have the authority to let you\u2026\"\n\nThe Minor Arcana consisted of 56 cards divided into four suits, each representing chalices, wands, swords, and pentacles.\n\nWhat is she talking about\u2026 Lumian was bewildered by her words.\n\nThis woman was stunningly beautiful and sophisticated, yet there was an air of eccentricity about her that suggested she was not entirely sane.\n\n\"Draw one,\" she urged, waving the Minor Arcana cards in her hand. \"It's complimentary, so there's no cost to try. It may be the solution to your dream predicament.\"\n\nLumian chuckled.\n\n\"My sister once said that free things often come at the most hefty price.\"\n\n\"That may be true,\" the lady said after some thought.\n\nShe laid down the Minor Arcana card with a delicate touch, careful not to upset the glass of Kirsch that sat beside it. \n\n\"But as long as you don't pay, no matter what, how can I, a foreigner, expect to make you pay in Cordu?\"\n\nThat's right\u2026 perhaps it's worth a try. It wasn't easy for me to get a hint about that dream. I gotta give it a shot, but what about the Warlock's curse? Maybe I should get Aurore's help? Lumian's mind raced with conflicting thoughts, and he couldn't decide what to do.\n\nThe woman didn't seem to mind his hesitation.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Lumian finally made up his mind. Slowly, he leaned forward and reached out his right hand. Carefully, he shuffled through the stack of Minor Arcana cards and extracted one from the middle.\n\n\"Seven of Wands.\" The languid woman's eyes drifted towards the card.\n\nThe image depicted a man in verdant attire, standing atop a mountain with a determined expression on his face. In his hand, he held a wand, poised for battle against the six wands representing his enemies that were attacking from the foot of the mountain.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Lumian asked.\n\nThe woman's lips curled into a smile.\n\n\"I shall interpret it for you. It symbolizes crisis, challenge, confrontation, courage, et cetera.\n\n\"However, what really matters is that this card now belongs to you. When the time comes, you will discover its true meaning.\"\n\n\"You're giving it to me?\" Lumian's confusion grew with each passing moment.\n\nCould this card truly be cursed?\n\nThe woman ignored his query and started to put away the remaining cards. She picked up her glass and finished the remaining Kirsch in a single gulp. \n\nWith graceful strides, she made her way towards the staircase on the side of Ol' Tavern and ascended to the second floor.\n\nIt was obvious that she lived there.\n\nLumian felt the urge to follow her, but something held him back. His thoughts were in disarray.\n\nIs this really an ordinary card?\n\nShe gave it to me. Does that mean she'll never be able to use that deck again?\n\nAurore might be able to shed some light on this\u2026\n\nAt this moment, Reimund approached Lumian.\n\n\"What's the matter, my friend?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. That foreigner was quite the looker, isn't she?\" Lumian said patronizingly.\n\n\"I reckon your sister, Aurore, is far more beautiful.\" Reimund then lowered his voice. \"Lumian, my p\u00e9p\u00e9 has been gone for ages. What should we do next?\"\n\nLumian, who was in a hurry to leave, pondered for a moment before answering, \n\n\"Firstly, we could track down an elder around your p\u00e9p\u00e9's age who's still kicking. Alternatively, we could head to the cathedral and examine the registry. Uh, but that's something to consider at a later time.\"\n\nLumian remembered his recent altercation with the padre and decided it was better to avoid the cathedral, unless it was absolutely necessary.\n\nAs the only cathedral in Cordu, it held significant power, even acting as a government entity. It recorded all significant events, including deaths, and marriages.\n\nBefore Reimund could ask any further, Lumian interjected, \"Let's split up and see who fits the bill. We'll inquire tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Reimund immediately agreed.\n\n...\n\nIn the semi-subterranean two-story building, Aurore listened intently to Lumian's tale, her piercing gaze fixed on the \"Wand\" card in his hand.\n\n\"It's an ordinary card, oui. I detect no malice or enchantments.\"\n\n\"Aurore, uh, Grande Soeur, what do you make of the foreigner's intentions? How did she know of my dream?\" Lumian asked.\n\nAurore shook her head.\n\n\"Now that she has shown us her hand, we can only wait and see.\"\n\n\"I will keep a watchful eye on her for the next few days.\n\n\"Oh\u2026 And take this card. It may cause change. But have no fear, I will be watching.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Lumian tried his best to relax.\n\n...\n\nIn the dead of the night, Lumian deftly tucked the Wand card into the garments draping over the back of the chair, then slipped under the covers and shut his eyes.\n\nBefore long, a dense, ashen mist once again enveloped his vision.\n\nWithout warning, he jolted awake within his reverie.\n\nHe sensed his mind clearing, and a newfound lucidity taking hold.\n\nYet, the dreamworld swathed in that same murky haze lingered on.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 0": "A price is always exacted for what fate bestows\u2014adapted from Zweig's Mary Queen of Scots.\n\n\"I'm a nobody, with no time to notice the brightness of the sun.\n\n\"My parents couldn't help me, and I wasn't highly educated. I had no choice but to make it on my own in the city.\n\n\"I'd applied to many jobs, but no one ever hired me. Maybe it's because I'm not good at expressing myself, and I'm not the best communicator. I guess I just haven't shown enough ability.\n\n\"Once, I'd eaten two loaves of bread over a three-day period. Hunger kept me up at night. At least I paid a month's rent in advance, so I didn't have to face the cold winter wind outside.\n\n\"Finally, I found a job at the hospital's morgue, keeping vigil over the dead.\n\n\"Nighttime in the hospital was colder than I could have ever imagined. The corridor's wall lights were out, leaving everything shrouded in darkness. I could barely see my feet, and the only light seeping out was from the rooms.\n\n\"Mon Dieu, it reeked of something fierce. The smell of death lingered in the air. And from time to time, we had to help move the bodies into the morgue.\n\n\"It wasn't the most glamorous of jobs, but it put bread on the table. Plus, the free time at night allowed me to study. Few people ventured to the morgue, but when they did, they were there delivering bodies or taking them away for cremation. I had to make do without books, as I couldn't afford them, nor did I see any hope of saving up enough for them.\n\n\"But I had to thank my predecessor for leaving so suddenly, as it allowed me to get this job.\n\n\"I dreamed of working the day shift. Sleeping during the day and being awake at night made my body weak and my head throb.\"\n\n\"One day, a new corpse was brought in. \n\n\"From what I'd heard, it's the body of my predecessor who suddenly left.\n\n\"I was intrigued by the mysterious disappearance of my predecessor, and as soon as the others left the room, I pulled out the cabinet and quietly opened the body bag.\n\n\"He was an old man, with bluish-white skin and wrinkles covering his face. The poor lighting only served to make him look scarier.\n\n\"He didn't have much hair. Most of it was white. He had been stripped of his clothes, not even a piece of cloth was left on him.\n\n\"As a dead man without a family, the movers couldn't resist the opportunity to cash in on the guy.\n\n\"I saw a strange mark on his chest. It was bluish-black. I can't really explain it. The light was too dim at the time.\n\n\"I reached out and touched the mark, only to realize there was nothing special about it.\n\n\"Looking at my predecessor, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd end up like him when I grew old\u2026\n\n\"I promised his body I'd be with him on his last journey, take him to the crematorium and then to the nearest free cemetery. I couldn't have the bureaucrats throwing him in the river or some forsaken land like trash.\n\n\"I knew I was gonna 'ave to sacrifice some shut-eye, but Dieu merci it was Sunday the next day. I could catch up on my lost sleep then.\n\n\"After saying that, I zipped up the bag and shoved it back in the cabinet.\n\n\"The room went darker and the shadows lengthened\u2026\n\n\"Since that day, every time I close my eyes, I'm swallowed by a thick fog.\n\n\"Something tells me I'm not alone. Something not quite human is coming my way. But nobody will listen. They think I've lost my mind in this job; they say I need a doctor\u2026\"\n\nA male customer sitting at the bar looked at the narrator who had suddenly stopped and asked, \"And?\"\n\nThe narrator suddenly stopped his tale, causing a male customer at the bar to take notice. This mid-thirties chap sported a drab duffel coat and pale yellow strides. His hair was slicked back, and he had a rough dark bowler hat by his side.\n\nHe seemed run-of-the-mill, like the rest of the punters in the alehouse, with dark locks and piercing blue peepers. Not particularly handsome, but not repugnant either. Nothing about him screamed for attention.\n\nThe narrator was a strapping lad in his late teens, with long limbs and chiseled features that could make any lass go weak in the knees. His short, jet-black hair and bright, blue eyes only added to his appeal.\n\nThe lad looked wistfully at the empty wine glass in front of him and let out a deep sigh.\n\n\"And then?\n\n\"Then I quit my job and returned to the countryside so that I can tell you this bullshit,\" the lad responded with a sly grin spreading across his face.\n\nThe male guest was taken aback.\n\n\"Were you just pulling our leg?\"\n\n\"Haha!\" Laughter erupted around the bar.\n\nHowever, the laughter was short-lived as a middle-aged man looked sternly at the slightly embarrassed customer and remarked, \"You ain't from around here, are ya? Lumian spins a different yarn every day. Yesterday, he was a penniless bloke who got dumped by his fianc\u00e9e, and today, he's a watchman for the dead!\"\n\n\"Aye, he talks about spending thirty years east of the Serenzo River and then thirty years to the right of it. He's full of hot air, that one!\" added another regular at the tavern.\n\nAll the men were farmers from the village of Cordu, wearing drab-colored tunics.\n\nThe black-haired lad, Lumian, leaned forward on the bar counter and rose to his feet. He flashed a cheeky grin and proclaimed, \"As you all know, I ain't the one making this up. My sister pens these tales. She's a writer for some column known as Novel Weekly or other.\"\n\nWith that, Lumian turned around, spread his arms wide, and beamed at the foreign customer. \n\n\"Looks like she's crafted quite the tale.\n\n\"I'm sorry you misunderstood.\"\n\nThe unremarkable man in the brown tweed shirt smiled and stood up.\n\n\"What an intriguing story.\n\n\"And how might I address you?\"\n\n\"Isn't it common courtesy to introduce oneself before inquiring of others?\" Lumian replied, returning the man's smile.\n\nThe foreigner nodded.\n\n\"My name is Ryan Koss.\n\n\"These are my companions, Valentine and Leah.\"\n\nThe last sentence referred to the man and woman sitting beside him.\n\nValentine, a man in his late twenties with powdered blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, wore a white vest, a blue tweed jacket, and black trousers. It was evident that he had put considerable effort into his attire, as if he had been priming himself for a special rendezvous.\n\nHe had a rather chilly look on his face, not even sparing a glance for the farmers and herders around him.\n\nLeah, on the other hand, was a striking young woman with long, light gray hair tied into an elaborate bun and a white veil perched atop her head. \n\nHer eyes matched her hair and she regarded Lumian with an open smile, clearly amused by their exchange.\n\nIn the glow of the gas lamps inside the tavern, the woman named Leah showed off her sharp nose and stunningly curved lips. She was definitely a stunner in the countryside like Cordu.\n\nShe wore a snug white pleated cashmere dress with a small off-white coat and a pair of Marseillan boots. There were two tiny silver bells fastened to her veil and boots. They jingled as she walked into the tavern, drawing the attention of many\u2014especially the men.\n\nIn their eyes, this was the kind of fashionable getup you'd only see in the big cities, like the provincial capital of Bigorre or even the capital city of Trier.\n\nLumian gave a nod of acknowledgement to the three foreigners.\n\n\"The name's Lumian Lee. You may address me as Lumian.\"\n\n\"Lee?\" Leah blurted out.\n\n\"What's the matter? Y'all got a problem with my last name?\" Lumian asked with a curious look on his face.\n\nRyan Koss took it upon himself to explain on Leah's behalf, \"Your last name is downright frightening. I nearly lost control of my voice just now.\"\n\nObserving the bewildered expressions of the farmers and herdsmen around him, he continued, \n\n\"Folks who have crossed paths with sailors and sea merchants are familiar with a saying that's making the rounds in the Five Seas:\n\n\"I'd rather come face to face with pirate Admirals or even kings than run into a bloke named Frank Lee.\n\n\"That person's last name is also Lee.\"\n\n\"Is he really that scary?\" Lumian inquired.\n\nRyan shook his head in response.\n\n\"I'm not exactly sure, but if such a legend exists, then it can't be far from the truth.\"\n\nHe switched topics and said to Lumian, \"Merci for the story. It merits a drink. What do you desire?\"\n\n\"A glass of La F\u00e9e Verte.\" Lumian didn't beat around the bush and settled back into his seat.\n\nRyan Koss furrowed his brow.\n\n\"'La F\u00e9e Verte'\u2026 Absinthe?\"\n\n\"I must remind you, absinthe is harmful to the human body. Such alcohol can lead to insanity and hallucinations.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect the trends of Trier to reach here,\" Leah chimed in with a grin.\n\nLumian acknowledged her comment tersely.\n\n\"So the people of Trier also enjoy La F\u00e9e Verte\u2026\"\n\n\"For us, life is already tough enough. No need to fret over a little more harm. This drink can calm our minds.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Ryan leaned back in his chair and turned to the bartender. \"A glass of La F\u00e9e Verte and another glass of C\u0153ur \u00c9pic\u00e9.\"\n\nC\u0153ur \u00c9pic\u00e9 was a renowned fruit-based spirit that had been distilled to perfection.\n\nThe thin, middle-aged man who had exposed Lumian's lies piped up. \"Give me a glass of La F\u00e9e Verte too. After all, I was the one who told the truth just now. I can even tell you the truth about this kid's situation!\" He glared at Lumian, daring him to object. \"Foreigner, I can tell you still have your doubts about the authenticity of that story.\"\n\n\"Pierre, you'd do anything for a free glass of alcohol,\" Lumian retorted, scowling.\n\nBefore Ryan could even respond, Lumian added, \"Why can't I tell my story and get an extra glass of La F\u00e9e Verte?\"\n\n\"Because no one knows if they should believe you,\" Pierre smirked. \"Your sister's favorite story to tell kids is 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf.' People who lie all the time lose their credibility eventually.\"\n\nLumian shrugged and watched as the bartender slid a glass of light green alcohol in front of him. \"\u00c7a va,\" he said, unbothered.\n\nRyan turned to Lumian. \n\n\"Is that all right?\"\n\n\"Sure thing, as long as your wallet can handle it,\" Lumian replied breezily.\n\n\"In that case, another glass of La F\u00e9e Verte,\" Ryan said with a nod.\n\nPierre's face lit up with a smile.\n\n\"Generous foreigner, you should steer clear of this one,\" he said, gesturing to Lumian. \"He's the most mischievous bloke in the whole village.\"\n\n\"Five years ago, his sister Aurore brought him back to the village,\" Pierre continued. \"He's been here ever since. Can you imagine? He was just a wee lad of thirteen at the time. How could he have made the trek to the hospital to become a corpse watchman? The nearest hospital is in Dari\u00e8ge at the foot of the mountain. It would take an entire afternoon to get there by foot.\"\n\n\"Brought back to the village?\" Leah inquired, her voice tinged with suspicion.\n\nShe tilted her head, causing her bells to tinkle.\n\nPierre nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"Aurore moved here six years ago. A year later, she went on a journey and brought this lad back with her. Said she found him on the road, a starving, homeless child. She planned to adopt him.\"\n\n\"Then, he took on Aurore's last name, Lee. Even his name, Lumian, was given by Aurore.\"\n\n\"I don't even remember what my name was before Aurore gave me the name,\" Lumian, unfazed by the revelation, flashed a grin and took a sip of absinthe.\n\nIt was clear that his past did not bother him in the slightest.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 2": "The woman turned her head to look out of Ol' Tavern's window.\n\n\"It's about time. I'll end this with giving you some pointers. Based on the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility, we know that humans and Beyonder characteristics combine to become Beyonders. Similarly, creatures and Beyonder characteristics combine to become Beyonder creatures. But what about items that combine with Beyonder characteristics?\" she asked, not giving Lumian a chance to answer.\n\n\"They are called mystical items. As items don't have will, spirit, and self-control, coupled with the combined effects of other factors, after they fuse with Beyonder characteristics, they will not only display corresponding special abilities but also bring about very strong negative effects. The various Churches tend to seal them and use suitable methods to activate them when needed. This is why mystical items are also called Sealed Artifacts.\n\n\"The mystical items that have been sealed by the various Churches have their own serial numbers and are divided into four grades: 3, 2, 1, and 0. The smaller the prefix number, the higher the danger. Among them, there are a limited number of Level 1 and 0 Sealed Artifacts that are extremely dangerous. The serial numbers are common to the various Churches and won't be repeated.\"\n\nLumian muttered, \"Level 0 Sealed Artifacts\u2026\"\n\nLumian had a deep impression that Sequence 0 was equivalent to a true god. This led him to make a certain connection and ask, \"Are these Sealed Artifacts formed by fallen deities or exterminated evil gods?\"\n\nHe had noticed that there were 22 pathways with Sequence 0s, but the number of deities clearly didn't add up. \n\nHowever, Lumian also recognized that his lack of understanding of evil gods and secret existences might have caused this confusion.\n\n\"Not all of them,\" the lady replied after thinking for a moment. \"Most of them are at the level of Angels. Only a small number have the ability to kill gods.\"\n\nLumian nodded. \"I understand. I won't underestimate the items in other people's hands.\"\n\nThe woman added, \"You can't underestimate the negative effects of Sealed Artifacts either. In the future, you will definitely come across Sealed Artifacts. \n\n\"Oh, and there's another category of items in the field of mysticism called extraordinary items. They are made by Beyonders of corresponding Sequences using their abilities, spirituality, or with the help of the spirit world or deities. They don't contain Beyonder characteristics, but they have a certain level of supernatural effects. However, their strength will gradually dissipate over time. Charms, lotions, and other items can only be used once. \n\n\"In comparison, Beyonder weapons are more stable and can be used for years.\n\n\"As a Hunter, you lack the ability to deal with Spirit Body ghost-type creatures before Sequence 7. If you have the chance in the future, consider obtaining the corresponding Sealed Artifacts or Beyonder items.\"\n\nLumian listened carefully and asked, \"The spirit world?\"\n\nHe had seen this term in Hidden Veil, but it did not provide sufficient explanation.\n\nThe woman quickly explained, \"From a mystical point of view, this world is divided into three levels: the real world, the spirit world, and the astral world. The rest are formed by attaching to one of these three, like the Underworld. \n\n\"I don't need to explain much about the real world; you already know it very well. The spirit world is a place where spirits reside, and many concepts of reality no longer exist there. You will gradually understand it in the future. As for the astral world, it originally referred to the world of gods, but now, the entire cosmos needs to be included in that definition.\"\n\nLumian was just asking casually, but after obtaining a preliminary answer, he immediately returned to the previous topic. \n\n\"Can a Hunter create Beyonder items?\" he asked, thinking that Warlocks could probably do it.\n\nThe lady shook her head before saying, \"Hunters can't rely on their own Sequence, but because their spirituality has been enhanced, they can learn ritualistic magic and pray to a deity or a hidden existence. They can use their responses to create charms, weapons, and other Beyonder items. \n\n\"However, I have to remind you that most hidden existences are very dangerous. It's best not to attempt praying to them. Otherwise, death would be the best outcome. And the seven orthodox gods basically won't respond to you unless you join the corresponding Church and become an official Beyonder.\"\n\n\"In other words, it's impossible for a Hunter to create a Beyonder item?\" Lumian asked, feeling somewhat disappointed.\n\nThe lady smiled and said, \"Not really. On the one hand, you can use the blood and saliva of certain Beyonder creatures to create poisonous weapons. In a sense, this can be considered a Beyonder item. On the other hand, after you unlock the secret of the dream, I'll tell you the honorific name of a great existence. You can pray to Him.\"\n\nLumian was shocked and suspicious. This was the first time she had used the word \"great\" as an adjective. He had never heard her use it to describe the Eternal Blazing Sun or the Hidden Sage. Who could this great existence be? Was it safe to pray to Him?\n\nThe more he learned about mysticism, the more he realized how little he knew.\n\nLumian tersely acknowledged her answer and asked, \"What are the corresponding Sequences 8 and 7 for Hunters?\"\n\nThe woman replied indifferently, \"Sequence 8 of the Hunter pathway is called Provoker, and Sequence 7 is Pyromaniac. \n\n\"Alright, that's all for today,\" she said as she stood up and walked towards the entrance to the second floor.\n\nAfter a few steps, she stopped and said over her shoulder, \"I forgot to remind you. Remember, you're just acting.\"\n\nJust acting\u2026 Lumian mulled over her words and thoughtfully asked, \"What if you take the role seriously?\"\n\n\"You will become less and less like yourself until one day\u2026\" The woman smiled and closed her mouth before turning around, walking to the stairs, and disappearing.\n\nShe didn't finish her sentence again\u2026 Lumian muttered silently.\n\nHe sensed that forgetting he was only acting would have serious consequences.\n\nLumian sat quietly in a corner of Ol' Tavern, reviewing the general knowledge the woman had just taught him to prevent forgetting anything.\n\nThe more he thought about it, the more he realized the importance of the two laws and one method. \n\nThey are like the main framework of mysticism. Everything else is derived from them.\n\nI wonder if Aurore knows\u2026\n\nAfter leaving Cordu, I'll discuss this problem with her\u2026\n\nUh, I wonder if that lady will allow me to inform Aurore of all these directly\u2026\n\n......\n\nAs Lumian left Ol' Tavern, he looked back and muttered to himself, Why haven't those three foreigners taken action yet? It's already Lent today\u2026\n\nHe continued to ponder as he made his way to the village square.\n\nAfter he finished asking if there was any reply, he saw Ava, Reimund, and the others approaching. \n\nAva was wearing a long white dress with a round headdress made of branches and flowers on her head, and a huge necklace hung around her neck. Brown branches and green leaves adorned her back, arms, waist, and legs, making her look like a fairy in the forest.\n\nShe was the main character of Lent, the Spring Elf.\n\nReimund and the other lads surrounded Ava, each carrying a basket woven from tree branches filled with grass, soil, rocks, leaves, and other items.\n\n\"Lumian, the blessing tour is about to begin!\" Ava exclaimed when her aqua-blue eyes saw him.\n\nHer face was filled with joy.\n\nReimund and the others also looked happy.\n\n\"Come on, let's go get the contributions!\"\n\nSince Novel Weekly had not yet replied, Lumian had nothing to do for the time being, so he decided to join the procession.\n\nThe young lads began singing loudly as they surrounded Ava and walked out of the square. \n\nAfter about ten meters, they stopped in front of the first building.\n\nLumian walked to the door and banged on it. \n\n\"The Spring Elf is here!\"\n\nThe door creaked open, and Naz\u00e9lie appeared in front of them. \n\nShe was the other female head of the family in the village, in her forties with the prefix 'Na.' Her black hair was tied up, and her blue eyes were smiling.\n\nAs the door opened, Ava took two steps forward, spread her arms, and began singing.\n\n\"I'm the elf of spring,\n\nWith a sweet face and a joyful ring,\n\nBringing happiness to everything,\n\nIn this season so charming.\n\nCome and sing, come and dance,\n\nLet's celebrate this time of chance,\n\nFor this is the only way,\n\nTo bless the land and make it stay.\"\n\nAfter the song, Ava took a clump of soil from Reimund's basket and handed it to Naz\u00e9lie. \n\n\"Thank you, 'Spring Elf',\" Naz\u00e9lie said, receiving it with a smile and handing a piece of cloth to Ava.\n\n\"Bumper harvest! Bumper harvest!\" Lumian and the other lads replied in unison.\n\nThis was a blessing ritual. The Spring Elf used singing and the giving of soil, grass, rocks, and other natural things to the villagers to bless them with a bumper harvest this year. The villagers needed to give something back as a contribution, or the blessing would become a curse.\n\nAfter Reimund received the cloth, Ava sang another song enthusiastically. \n\nOnly then did they bid farewell to Naz\u00e9lie and head to the next house.\n\nA portion of the dedications received during the blessing tour would be thrown into the river in the waterside ritual, and the rest would be placed in the final ritual. After Lent was over, the girl who was the embodiment of the Spring Elf had the right to choose some to take away. \n\nThis was a considerable gain.\n\nIf Cordu really experienced a bumper harvest this year, Ava, as the embodiment of the \"Spring Elf\", would be widely believed to have received the love of the elves and blessings of spring. Whoever married her would have bumper harvests all the time. \n\nIn that case, she had a chance of marrying someone from a good family.\n\nThe blessing procession sang all the way to Lumien's house, where Aurore opened the door. She had changed into a light-colored pleated dress with a straight collar and had bunned her blond hair.\n\nAva walked over and sang the same song again.\n\n\"I'm the elf of spring\u2026\"\n\nAurore listened with a smile and handed Ava a small pottery jar. \n\n\"Thank you, Spring Elf.\"\n\nLumian glanced at the jar of animal lard and felt that his sister was too generous. \n\nThey had no farmland except for a small vegetable field at the back of their house and did not need to worry about the harvest at all.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 1": "Ryan apologized politely to Lumian. \"Forgive me, I did not expect such a situation,\" he said.\n\nLumian chuckled.\n\n\"Are you suggesting we need another glass of La F\u00e9e Verte?\"\n\nWithout waiting for Ryan's response, he changed the subject. \n\n\"What brings foreigners like you to Cordu? Are you here to buy wool or leather?\"\n\nMany of Cordu's residents made their living as shepherds. \n\nRyan breathed a silent sigh of relief and seized the opportunity to explain their true purpose.\n\n\"We came to visit the Eternal Blazing Sun Church's padre, Guillaume B\u00e9net, but he seems to be absent from both his home and the cathedral.\"\n\nPierre, who had enjoyed Ryan's free absinthe, kindly reminded him that there was only one church in Cordu.\n\nThe other locals around the bar counter were all drinking, but no one answered Ryan's question. The name seemed to represent some kind of taboo or authority that couldn't be openly discussed.\n\nLumian took a sip of wine and thought for a few seconds before offering his assistance. \n\n\"I can roughly guess where the padre is. Do you need me to take you there?\"\n\nLeah didn't stand on ceremony. \"If it's not too much trouble,\" she said.\n\nRyan nodded in agreement. \n\n\"Once you've finished your drink.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Lumian raised his glass and finished the light-green alcohol.\n\nHe put down his glass and got to his feet.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nRyan expressed his gratitude, \"Merci beaucoup.\" He gestured for Valentine and Leah to stand up and thanked Lumian, \"Thank you so much.\"\n\nLumian's face lit up with a smile. \"It's no problem at all. You heard my story and I enjoyed a complimentary drink. That makes us friends, n'est-ce pas?\"\n\n\"Oui.\" Ryan nodded.\n\nLumian's grin widened, stretching from ear to ear. He opened his arms wide, beckoning the other party in for a hug.\n\n\"Ah, it is good to meet you, my cabbages,\" he exclaimed with fervor.\n\nRyan, who was about to be enveloped in a bear hug, froze.\n\n\"Cabbages?\"\n\nHis expression was a mixture of perplexity and embarrassment.\n\nValentine and Leah mirrored his expression.\n\n\"It is a term of endearment we use for our friends,\" Lumian explained with innocent sincerity. \"Everyone in the Dari\u00e8ge region is aware of it. It has been a tradition for centuries, believe me, my cabbages.\"\n\nLeah couldn't help but glance around, producing the tinkling sounds.\n\nPierre and the others nodded in agreement, assuring the newcomers that Lumian's words were true. However, the grins on their faces hinted that they were pleased to see foreigners struggling to comprehend their affectionate greetings.\n\nLumian stroked his chin thoughtfully.\n\n\"Don't you fancy it?\"\n\n\"Then I shall opt for a different option. It can also be used for friends.\n\n\"My dear bunnies, my darling chicks, my lovely ducks, or perhaps my adorable lambs? Which one tickles your fancy?\" \n\nBut Ryan's expression was as stiff as a board, and Valentine's brow furrowed in confusion.\n\nLeah let out a sigh, a mix of exasperation and amusement.\n\n\"Let's just stick with cabbage, shall we? At least it sounds normal.\"\n\nPhew. Ryan let out a quiet sigh and gently grasped Valentine's elbow. He gave a slight nod and remarked, \"They all seem like precious treasures in the family.\"\n\nWithout awaiting Lumian's response, he swiveled his body and addressed the bartender, \"How much will it be?\"\n\n\"Two verl d'or,\" replied the bartender, eyeing the glasses lined up on the counter.\n\nRyan settled the bill, and Leah shifted the conversation to a different subject.\n\n\"Lumian is an uncommon name.\"\n\n\"At least better than names like Pierre and Guillaume,\" Lumian countered with a grin. \"If you were to call out Pierre in this place, a third of the people would turn their heads. Call out Guillaume, and another third will respond. As for this gentleman\u2026\"\n\nHe gestured to the skinny middle-aged man sipping his free drink.\n\n\"His full name is Pierre Guillaume.\"\n\nLeah flashed a smile, skirting the topic of cabbage.\n\nAs they departed from the tavern, Lumian turned around and surveyed the surroundings.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" Leah inquired with curiosity.\n\nLumian pondered for a moment and replied thoughtfully, \"It's not just the three of you foreigners who came to the tavern today. Another person arrived earlier, but I don't know when they left.\"\n\n\"What did they look like?\" Ryan asked with a serious expression.\n\nLumian took a moment to reflect.\n\n\"A lady. Very sophisticated. You can tell she's from the city with just one glance. I can't describe her appearance. Why don't I sketch her for you?\"\n\n\"Do you know how to draw?\" Leah queried, aware of Lumian's idiosyncrasies.\n\nLumian chortled.\n\n\"I don't.\"\n\n\"In that case, let's locate the padre first,\" Ryan decided, drawing the conversation to a close.\n\nCordu was a place devoid of street lamps at night, yet the twinkling stars above provided a faint glimmer that allowed the four of them to navigate the road. The yellowish light emanating from the windows on either side only added to the ethereal ambiance.\n\nAs they approached the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral situated in the village square, the grandiose structure appeared somewhat blurry in the darkness, as if it was merging with the night.\n\n\"We've been here before. There's no one here,\" Valentine grumbled with a frown.\n\nLumian smiled and said, \"No one at the front door doesn't mean there's no one elsewhere.\"\n\nHe then proceeded to lead Ryan and the others around the front of the cathedral towards the cemetery, where they found a dark brown wooden door.\n\nLumian didn't wait for Ryan to knock. Instead, he reached over and fiddled with the keyhole before opening the side door with a creak.\n\n\"That's not very nice, is it?\" Ryan frowned.\n\nLeah nodded in agreement, her bells tinkling.\n\n\"We're here to visit the padre, not to fight him.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" Lumian acquiesced.\n\nHe closed the wooden door and knocked lightly. \n\n\"Hey, is anyone there? I'll come in if you don't answer,\" he muttered in a low voice that was barely audible in the night.\n\nThere was no response from inside the cathedral.\n\nWithout hesitation, Lumian pushed open the door and gestured inside. \n\n\"Go on in.\"\n\nRyan hesitated. He looked at the darkness behind the door and glanced at his companions.\n\n\"Okay.\" He took a step forward, slow but firm.\n\nLeah and Valentine followed closely behind.\n\nThe four silvery bells adorning Leah's boots and veil were eerily silent.\n\nThe environment was dim and eerie as the four of them made their way forward.\n\nOut of nowhere, Ryan came to a halt and muttered in a low voice, \"What's that noise?\"\n\n\"Yes, I heard it too,\" Lumian agreed.\n\nWithout wasting any time, he forcefully pushed the door aside, and it opened with a loud clang, revealing what lay beyond.\n\nThe dimly lit space resembled a confessional. A beam of starlight shone through, revealing a naked man in his prime, lying atop a fair-skinned woman.\n\nThe scene stunned everyone, including the man and the woman. \n\nSuddenly, the man sat up and bellowed at Ryan and his team, \"Sacrebleu! You've ruined the holy church's plans!\"\n\nAmidst the reverberating roar, Lumian, who had quietly approached behind the group, waved his hand and spoke quickly, \"Ah, it seems we have discovered our padre. Au revoir, my cabbages!\"\n\nBefore anyone could react, Lumian dashed towards the side door, leaving his words to drift away in the wind.\n\nAs the team stood in shock, Leah, Ryan, and Valentine couldn't shake the words of the middle-aged man, Pierre Guillaume, from their minds: \"\u2026you should steer clear of this one. He's the most mischievous bloke in the whole village.\"\n\n...\n\nLumian sauntered down the country road, hands tucked in his pockets while whistling a tune under the stars.\n\n\"As expected, the padre is having an affair with Madame Pualis.\" \n\n\"Mon dieu, these foreigners exude an air of prestige. The padre would never dream of crossing them. He must pay an exorbitant sum to keep his sordid dalliances under wraps and preserve his standing within the cathedral.\"\n\n\"Hmph, he only has himself to blame for lusting after Aurore. I have been biding my time for this chance\u2026\"\n\nAs Lumian muttered to himself, he returned to his abode on the outskirts of the hamlet.\n\nThe structure he called home was a peculiar semi-subterranean two-story affair. The ground floor doubled as both a kitchen and a lounge. A hefty oven and a grandiose stove dominated the room.\n\n\"Aurore! Aurore!\" Lumian hollered as he trudged up the stairs.\n\nNo reply.\n\nThe upper storey was divided into three chambers and a lavatory, all the doors stood open. \n\nLumian peeped into each room but couldn't find his sister.\n\nHe mulled it over for a moment, then marched to the end of the corridor and clambered up the ladder that led to the roof.\n\nThe roof was a fiery orange, painted by the twilight sky. In the center sat a figure, holding their knees and staring contemplatively at the sparkling stars.\n\nThis was an exquisite woman, exceptionally so. Her long and thick locks were a shade of gold, her eyes a pale blue, and her facial features were intricate and refined.\n\nHer gaze was fixated on the cosmos, her countenance serene, akin to that of a statue.\n\nLumian remained silent. He shifted to her side and sat next to her.\n\nHe lifted his head, gazing at the dense forest in the distance, absorbing the susurrus of the wind blowing through the trees.\n\nAfter a while, the woman raised her arms and stretched, paying no heed to her appearance.\n\n\"Aurore, I don't understand why you come up here so often. What's so interesting about this view?\" Lumian commented.\n\n\"Call me Grande Soeur!\" Aurore scolded playfully, tapping Lumian's head with her finger.\n\nAurore sighed and thought to herself, \"A philosopher once said that there are only two things worth revering in this world. One is the morality in one's heart, and the other is the cosmos above one's head.\"\n\nLumian noticed his sister's slightly melancholic expression and flashed a grin. \n\n\"I know the answer to this question. Emperor Roselle said so!\"\n\n\"Pfft\u2026\" Aurore laughed.\n\nShe took a sniff and raised her beautiful golden eyebrows.\n\n\"You've been drinking again!\"\n\n\"This is called socializing.\" Lumian took the opportunity to recount what had just happened. \"I met three foreigners\u2026\"\n\nAurore could not help but laugh.\n\n\"I'm really afraid that the padre will have a heart attack.\"\n\nHer expression then turned serious. \"Lumian, don't provoke the padre anymore. It'll be troublesome if we get a new one.\"\n\n\"But I can't stand his face\u2026\" Lumian complained before Aurore stood up.\n\nShe looked down at her brother and smiled.\n\n\"Alright, it's bedtime, my inebriated brother,\" Aurore said with a smile as she threw out some silver dust.\n\nAurore flew down from the roof like a bird and entered the window on the second floor, leaving Lumian behind.\n\nLumian watched this quietly and shouted anxiously, \"What about me?\"\n\n\"Climb down yourself!\" Aurore replied mercilessly.\n\nLumian pursed his lips, his smile fading bit by bit.\n\nHe watched the silver specks of light disappear in the night sky, sighed softly, and muttered to himself, \"I wonder when I'll be able to possess such extraordinary powers\u2026\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 6": "Once Lumian had departed from the Ol' Tavern, he found himself standing on the uneven road, uncertain of where to go next. \n\nThe morning sun beat down upon him, albeit with a slight chill in the air.\n\nAs he deliberated his next move, Reimund Greg emerged from the side. \n\n\"I was just looking for you.\"\n\nLumian quickly regained his composure and queried, \"What's the issue?\"\n\nReimund appeared taken aback. \n\n\"Have you forgotten? Today, we're supposed to seek out the elderly, around the same age as my p\u00e9p\u00e9, and inquire about the legend of the Warlock.\"\n\nLumian groaned, pressing his hand against his forehead in agony. \n\n\"Is that so? Why can't I recall? Or is this just your imagination?\"\n\nReimund's expression shifted from one of concern to one of fear. Just as he was about to inquire further and confirm whether he had imagined the events of the previous day, Lumian's face lit up with a mischievous grin.\n\n\"You rascal, you're playing a joke on me again!\" Reimund cursed, unable to contain his annoyance.\n\n\"You need to work on your cursing,\" Lumian chided, shaking his head in disappointment. \"Even Ava can curse better than you.\"\n\nAva Lizier, the beautiful daughter of Cordu Village's renowned shoemaker Guillaume Lizier, was now a goose herder.\n\nReimund's expression shifted as he muttered, \"Ava\u2026\"\n\nHe then looked at Lumian. \"She's our friend, right?\"\n\nLumian nodded with a smile. \"Indeed she is.\"\n\nThe trio, along with Guillaume of the Berrys and Ava's cousin Az\u00e9ma Lizier, were inseparable teenagers who often spent their days together.\n\n\"Why don't we bring Ava on board to help us uncover the truth behind the legend?\" Reimund suggested. \"As you know, her father always said, 'Why must a dowry be paid when a woman gets married? How many good families have fallen like this?' It pains her to hear it. She might be relieved if she could get some treasure or reward from the investigation.\"\n\n\"I've also heard the heads of several families in the village say similar things, including our padre,\" Lumian added with a sly grin. \"They wish their brothers would stay at home forever. Even if they get married, they won't venture out alone to establish a family. That would require them to split the assets and give them their deserving share.\"\n\nLumian shot a furtive glance at Reimund and continued, \"Therefore, many families prefer to let one of their children become a shepherd. This way, he won't get married and will have a certain income. Most of the time, he can support himself.\"\n\nReimund's expression gradually darkened as he considered the implications of this issue. \n\nHe had never thought too deeply about it before.\n\nThis was precisely why he enjoyed spending time with Lumian. Although most people in the village believed that Lumian had a poor character and enjoyed lying and playing tricks, he was actually more knowledgeable than anyone his age. Reimund, on the other hand, felt like he didn't know much and spent his days in a daze, simply following through with his family's arrangements.\n\nIt's good that you know\u2026 Lumian thought to himself before skillfully steering the conversation back to their investigation.\n\n\"It's too late now. We must hurry up and ask around. We will get Ava tomorrow. Yes, we can also bring Guillaume-junior and Az\u00e9ma on board later. Not only will this potentially lead to gains, but it will also be a fascinating activity that can train our abilities.\"\n\n\"Bring Guillaume-junior and Az\u00e9ma too?\" Reimund grumbled begrudgingly. \n\nThe more people involved, the less his share of the rewards would be. \n\nFurthermore, if he included them, he would have fewer chances to win over Ava's affections.\n\nLumian regarded him with a touch of kindness and pity in his gaze. \n\nSilly child, do you think Ava will fall for you? Her eyebrows are very high, and she only wants to marry into a good family. She clearly has a certain favorable impression of me, a 'villain', yet she can control herself\u2026\n\nIn the Dari\u00e8ge region, having \"high eyebrows\" meant having high standards, and they wouldn't settle for just any average bloke.\n\n\"My sister always said there is strength in numbers,\" Lumian explained simply. \"Who are the old croakers that we need to visit?\"\n\n\"You didn't investigate?\" Reimund asked in surprise.\n\nHow could I have the energy to investigate after the incident with the Wand card? Lumian smiled and quipped, \"Of course I investigated. I am just testing your ability to gather information.\"\n\nReimund had no doubts.\n\n\"There are nine elders who are still alive in the village. They are about the same age as my p\u00e9p\u00e9, or a little older\u2026\"\n\nSix women and three men. Ladies do live longer\u2026 Lumian listened quietly, deep in thought. \n\n\"There's no need to visit the last two. They're from another village and came here through marriage. \n\n\"Let's start with Naroka. She's the oldest and might have been an adult when the Warlock incident happened.\"\n\nNaroka's real name wasn't actually Naroka. It was a title of respect for her.\n\nIn Riston Province, married women from prominent families or those who were the actual heads of households were entitled to the title \"Madame\". More than that, their names were marked with an \"a\" to proclaim their femininity, and prefixed with \"Na\" to signify their authority as Madames reigning over their domains.\n\nMadame Pualis's family had been in decline for a long time, and at home she dutifully deferred to her husband B\u00e9ost, the provincial administrator. Therefore, she didn't have a \"Na\" prefix or an \"a\" suffix. She could only be addressed as \"Madame\".\n\nNaroka had been widowed early on in life, and as a result, she took over the family's accounts. Despite her two sons coming of age, getting married, and having children of their own, she kept her hand positioned squarely on the purse strings of the family fortunes. \n\nThis was a rare occurrence in Cordu, where men usually took charge of the family's affairs. In families where the father was absent, the eldest child would naturally take back the authority to manage the entire family from their mother once they reached adulthood.\n\n\"Okay,\" Reimund acquiesced without questioning Lumian's decision.\n\nAs they walked by a few buildings, Lumian spotted four old women basking in the sun as they chatted casually in front of a two-story house. \n\nThey sat very close to each other, catching lice on each other's bodies, which was a form of entertainment in the countryside of the Intis Republic that served to bring people closer and express affection.\n\n\"Do we ask her now?\" Reimund hesitated, concerned that their pursuit of the truth behind the legend might spread throughout the village.\n\n\"Let's wait a little longer,\" Lumian replied solemnly, knowing that many rumors in the village were generated and spread through such gatherings.\n\nAfter a while, the other three old women left one by one because they still had work to do at home.\n\n\"Good morning, Naroka.\" Lumian immediately walked over.\n\nNaroka's hair was grizzled, and her eyes were slightly turbid. She wore a dark dress made of rough cloth, and her hands were covered in a layer of chicken skin with obvious patches on her face.\n\n\"When will Aurore join us? Many people in the village miss her,\" Naroka asked with a smile.\n\nThe men, I suppose? Lumian entered a state where he spoke his truth while the other talked about another matter and asked curiously, \"Naroka, have you really seen a real Warlock? The one whose coffin nine bulls couldn't move?\"\n\nNaroka's visage shifted ever so slightly.\n\n\"Who told you that?\"\n\n\"His p\u00e9p\u00e9 came back one night to tell him.\" Lumian began to spout nonsense.\n\nNaroka was stunned. \"Can souls really return\u2026\"\n\n\"My papa told me that P\u00e9p\u00e9 had mentioned it when he was alive,\" Reimund interjected, unable to watch Lumian deceive the elderly woman.\n\nNaroka's expression fell. After a moment of contemplation, she spoke up.\n\n\"Before he passed, none of us knew he was a Warlock. He acted perfectly normal.\"\n\nJust like how you don't know that Aurore is a Warlock\u2026 Lumian thought to himself.\n\n\"Until he suddenly died and that owl flew over\u2026\" Naroka trailed off, lost in her memories.\n\nThe rest of her tale mirrored the legend.\n\nLumian pressed further.\n\n\"Where did that Warlock reside at that time?\"\n\nNaroka glanced at him.\n\n\"It's where you and Aurore are dwelling now.\n\n\"After that Warlock was laid to rest, the padre and a few others ransacked the place and burned it to the ground. For two or three decades, no one dared to approach that site. Eventually, the matter was forgotten. Later, Aurore came and purchased the land to rebuild the house.\"\n\nOur place? Lumian's heart skipped a beat.\n\nThis answer was completely beyond his expectations!\n\nIn a flash, he realized that there were a multitude of problems he had previously overlooked. \n\nWith Aurore's knack for making money and her mysterious, unearthly abilities, why on earth would she settle down in the rural countryside of Cordu?\n\nCities like the provincial capital, Bigorre, the bustling textile center of Suhit, or even the capital itself, Trier, would be far better options. Even if Aurore was seeking a place with fresh air and a pristine environment, these urban centers boasted plenty of areas that would suit her needs.\n\nAurore once told him, \"The best way to hide is to hide in a big city\u2026\" Lumian's mind raced as he struggled to calm himself.\n\nToday, he learned that the land Aurore had chosen for their home, the land where their house stood, had once belonged to a powerful Warlock\u2026\n\n\"Where is the Warlock buried?\" Reimund interjected, unable to contain his curiosity. \n\nWith no hope of finding riches in Lumian's home, he could only hope that the Warlock's body held some sort of valuable secret.\n\nNaroka said with amusement, \"This was quite the affair. It undoubtedly sounded the alarm for the padre.\n\n\"In the old days, nine bulls were gathered to pull the coffin to the cemetery beside the cathedral. The padre performed a ritual to purify it. Eventually, the body was cremated and the remains were buried in a grave.\"\n\nReimund couldn't conceal his disappointment and muttered, \"I see.\"\n\n\"Why do you inquire?\" Naroka scrutinized Reimund's face before questioning.\n\nLumian cackled and spun a tale that sounded more like a fabrication. \"We seek the Warlock's treasure.\"\n\n\"Kid, don't waste your time daydreaming,\" Naroka warned.\n\n\"Understood,\" Lumian replied meekly.\n\nLumian and Reimund bade Naroka farewell and hit the road toward the townsquare.\n\n\"There ain't no hope, Lumian. None at all,\" Reimund muttered, his spirits sinking as they circled a building.\n\n\"Indeed. All that could have been burned, has been burned. All that could have been taken, was taken decades ago,\" Lumian replied, nodding in agreement.\n\nDespite the bleakness of their situation, Lumian wasn't disappointed thanks to the opportunity in his dream.\n\nReimund agreed.\n\n\"Aye, you're right. Of all the tales, only that blasted owl still remains.\"\n\nLumian's eyes lit up as he turned his gaze to the forest beyond the village. \"Owl\u2026\" he murmured.\n\nReimund recoiled in horror and added hastily, \"But it must have died years ago. \n\nHe wasn't one for consorting with the likes of owls and other evil creatures.\n\nDown south in Intis, owls, nightingales, and ravens were thought to be sinister beings that served demons, stealing away human souls and bringing only misfortune.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 3": "Lumian put his physics knowledge to work and pondered for a moment.\n\n\"Why not just call it the law of conservation?\"\n\n\"That's another law, but don't worry about the details for now.\" The woman nodded in agreement. \"Essentially, it's the same as the law of indestructibility, but with additional prerequisites and specific elaborations.\"\n\nIs that so\u2026 Lumian considered for a moment before speaking. \n\n\"So, according to the law of indestructibility, if I want to obtain Beyonder characteristics, I can target other Beyonders, in addition to hunting the corresponding monsters?\"\n\nSince Beyonder characteristics were indestructible, a Beyonder's death would result in the appearance of the corresponding Beyonder characteristics.\n\nThe woman's face showed a certain amount of emotion. \n\n\"You're very perceptive.\"\n\n\"Therefore, this law isn't suitable for most Beyonders to know. It would result in Beyonders killing each other, and they won't be able to trust each other.\"\n\nLumian didn't mind this. \"Even without this law, humans still kill each other. In the real world, there's plenty of suspicion, bullying, and murder.\"\n\nThe woman replied with interest, \"But at least there's still a certain warmth and light of the human spirit.\"\n\nLumian pondered for a while before speaking. \n\n\"Looking at it from another perspective, this law should become a consensus among Beyonders. That way, the weak can be prepared in advance and not become easy prey for those who know.\"\n\nThe lady nodded slightly.\n\n\"That does make some sense. Actually, if battles between Beyonders happen frequently enough, people involved would likely be able to figure it out.\"\n\nShe then introduced, \"The second law is called the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Convergence.\"\n\n\"Convergence\u2026\" Lumian struggled to understand. \n\nHe couldn't quite derive it from their earlier conversation.\n\nThe woman's expression turned serious.\n\n\"As the creator of this world, even if the Oldest One splits into Beyonder characteristics of different pathways, it doesn't mean that He has completely withdrawn from the stage. His mind is scattered among the different Beyonder characteristics and will never be obliterated unless this world completely perishes.\n\n\"These minds are similar to a brand, but they have the instinct to reassemble and revive the Oldest One. \n\n\"In other words, after you become a Beyonder, you're more likely to encounter other Beyonders than before. You're more likely to encounter Beyonders of the same pathway or neighboring pathways than Beyonders of other pathways. This is the convergence of fate. The higher the Sequence, the more obvious this situation becomes.\"\n\nLumian had many questions, but he decided to start with the most important one. \n\n\"So, combined with the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility, can I conclude that convergence leads to massacres?\"\n\nThe lady once again revealed an approving expression.\n\n\"You're very perceptive on such matters.\"\n\n\"It's not a problem when your Sequence is low, but at the demigod stage, especially after becoming an Angel, you must find a way to weaken or avoid the effects of convergence.\"\n\n\"Demigod, Angel?\" Lumian was surprised and intrigued upon hearing these terms, even though he knew that every Sequence could eventually become a true god.\n\nThe lady casually explained, \"Demigod is a term for Beyonders from Sequence 4 to Sequence 1, meaning half-god, half-human.\n\n\"Among them, Sequence 4 and Sequence 3 are known as Saints, while Sequence 2 and Sequence 1 are called Angels. There are other names beyond that, but it's best if you not know them for now.\"\n\nSaints\u2026 Angels\u2026 Lumian thought of the saints and angels from different regions. \n\nThey were real?\n\nThe remains of a Saint are the corpses of Saints. There are Beyonder characteristics left behind?\n\nLumian asked, feeling a little afraid, \"So every Beyonder characteristic has the mental imprint of the Oldest One, and the higher the Sequence, the more is left behind? \n\n\"Wouldn't the person who consumes the potion be affected in other ways?\"\n\nThe lady confirmed with a smile, \"Yes, why do you think this path is filled with danger and madness? \n\n\"Losing control is one of the main reasons why consuming a potion can be so dangerous.\n\n\"To be specific, it's losing control of supernatural powers and one's own mind and transforming into a terrifying monster.\"\n\n\"Is there another reason?\" Lumian pressed.\n\nThe lady tersely grunted.\n\n\"Firstly, the intensity of the mental imprint mainly depends on the level of the owners of the corresponding Beyonder characteristics. Their obsession and madness before death also contribute to it. Secondly, consuming the potion in the wrong order or method can cause a huge conflict in the body. Thirdly, some existences can use the consumption of potions to exert influence. For example, every time the Mystery Pryer pathway consumes a potion, they passively receive knowledge instillation from the Hidden Sage.\"\n\nSimilar to the voice I heard after drinking the Hunter potion? Lumian deliberated for a moment before recounting his encounter truthfully. \n\n\"Which entity's influence is that?\"\n\nThe next second, he saw the expression of the lady opposite him become a little odd.\n\nShe said solemnly, \"Some existences can corrupt and take control of you just by knowing of their existence. \n\n\"Unfortunately, the owner of that voice is one such existence. It's not suitable for you to know Their honorific name at the moment.\"\n\nLumian's mind raced with thoughts. That horrifying? A Sequence 0 true god? But most people in Intis and I know about the Eternal Blazing Sun and the God of Steam and Machinery. There's nothing wrong with them\u2026 Could there be a difference between a true god and an evil god? But she mentioned the Hidden Sage, who is also a Sequence 0. Is it possible she doesn't know who it is and is using vague terms to mask her ignorance? \n\nHe gave up on the topic, considering his own strength, and asked about another intriguing term.\n\n\"What is a neighboring pathway?\"\n\nThe woman's expression returned to normal as she explained, \"Under normal circumstances, if you choose a pathway and consume the corresponding potion, you can only go down that path one step at a time. Otherwise, you will definitely lose control, or at the very least, half-lose control. However, there are always exceptions. Every pathway has one or more neighboring pathways. You can jump over at a specific Sequence, such as Sequence 4, which divides between humans and demigods.\"\n\n\"Hunter's neighboring pathway is Assassin.\"\n\nAssassin\u2026 Sounds cooler than Hunter\u2026 Lumian asked with concern, \"Which pathways neighbor Mystery Pryer?\n\n\"Will one no longer be affected by the Hidden Sage after jumping to a neighboring pathway?\"\n\n\"The Savant pathway. The current Sequence 0 is the God of Steam and Machinery,\" the woman replied calmly. \"After jumping over, one will still be affected by the Hidden Sage, but the degree will decrease significantly. However, the corresponding Beyonder characteristics still exist unless one finds a way to expel them.\"\n\n\"How?\" Lumian asked, surprised.\n\n\"The easiest way is to have children. In mysticism, there's a high chance of transferring the corresponding Beyonder characteristics to a child through heredity,\" the woman explained. \"Alternatively, you can use the special abilities of certain pathways, but there's a certain risk, and you have to pay a considerable price.\"\n\nLumian nodded before raising another question. \n\n\"Can I switch only at a particular Sequence?\"\n\nThe chances of reaching Sequence 4 and becoming a demigod were slim.\n\nThe lady glanced at him.\n\n\"In theory, it's possible to switch at a lower Sequence, but the risk of losing control is much higher. Unless there's no other way, it's best not to attempt it.\"\n\nThe woman paused before saying, \"I've finished explaining the two laws. Now, I'll explain the method. \n\n\"This is one of the most important pieces of knowledge in the mystical world.\"\n\nMost important? Lumian instinctively straightened his back, feeling abnormally focused.\n\nThe lady continued to speak, \"It's called the 'acting method.' \n\n\"It's a way to help you digest the potion. By digesting the potion, the risk of losing control will be greatly reduced when consuming the next Sequence potion.\"\n\nIt's no wonder I can't drink the Sequence 9 potion today and drink the Sequence 8 potion tomorrow\u2026 I have to use the \"acting method\" to digest the previous potion\u2026 Lumian came to a realization.\n\nHe did not interrupt her and listened attentively to her explanation.\n\n\"Remember, it's digestion, not control.\n\n\"What's the acting method? It involves acting according to the name of a Sequence like an actor. By reconciling the differences between one's body and the remnant mental imprints of the Beyonder characteristics, one can obtain the corresponding recognition. This allows them to bypass the barrier that originally existed and fuse the Beyonder characteristics with themselves.\"\n\n\"So, I have to act like a Hunter and hunt in the mountains every day?\" Lumian asked attentively.\" Lumian appeared as attentive as a student.\n\nThe lady shook her head.\n\n\"That's just the most superficial form of acting. We not only have to understand the surface meaning of a Sequence's name, but we also have to investigate its deeper meaning. For example, the city is also a jungle. Everyone is both prey and hunter.\"\n\nI'm familiar with this\u2026 Lumian was already familiar with this concept, which he had learned during his days as a vagrant.\n\n\"How can you be sure that you have digested the potion and can advance to the next Sequence?\" Lumian asked curiously.\n\nThe lady smiled.\n\n\"You will sense it when the potion is truly digested.\"\n\nAlright\u2026 Lumian didn't continue the topic and asked in puzzlement, \"Who named the different Sequences?\" \n\nWhy could he digest the potion just by acting them out?\n\nThe lady's expression turned serious.\n\n\"The earliest Sequence divisions came from the remnants of the Oldest One's splintering. It was a stone slab filled with mystical knowledge. \n\n\"As it involves the secret of becoming a deity, it's called the Blasphemy Slate. \n\n\"In ancient times, during the end of the Second Epoch and the entire Third Epoch, a powerful deity close to the Oldest One appeared. He was called the Ancient Sun God. After He perished, a second Blasphemy Slate was born from His remains. All the current Sequence names and potion formulas came from it.\"\n\nThat's not the Second and Third Epoch history I learned\u2026 Lumian muttered inwardly.\n\nThe lady continued to speak, \"When Emperor Roselle was alive, he used the second Blasphemy Slate as a reference to create a Cards of Blasphemy set based on tarot cards. There are a total of 22 cards, and each card represents a pathway of the divine.\"\n\nLumian was astonished. \"Emperor Roselle is also a Beyonder?\"\n\nAs an ordinary Intisian, it was difficult for him not to feel a certain amount of admiration for Emperor Roselle.\n\nThe woman laughed. \"Otherwise?\"\n\nLumian asked, \"Was he powerful?\"\n\n\"Almost a deity,\" the lady said concisely.\n\nThat amazing? Lumian was stunned but felt that it was only right.\n\nHe thought for a moment and said, \"Then, wouldn't the diary left behind by Emperor Roselle be very valuable?\"\n\nThe lady nodded.\n\n\"Yes, but there are very, very few people who can decipher those strange writings.\"\n\nLumian fell into deep thought. Aurore seems to have some of Emperor Roselle's diary transcripts in her collection. She seems to be able to decipher them\u2026 Could it be that a portion of her strength comes from there?\n\n",
        "Chapter: 4": "The brownish-yellow eyes of the owl glowed in the dark, fixating on Lumian as it perched on the branch. \n\nLumian was no longer as intimidated as he was during their previous encounters. He yelled, \"Whatcha looking at? Say something if you dare!\"\n\nLumian didn't have to provoke the owl, but he hoped it would reveal the owl's true motive. He couldn't bear the thought of the creature lurking around and staring at him in the dead of night. \n\nTo his surprise, the owl remained silent and didn't make a sound.\n\nAfter a few tense seconds, the owl spread its wings and flew off into the darkness. \n\n\"Crazy!\" Lumian let out a frustrated curse, but he didn't dare let his guard down.\n\nLumian remained focused on scrutinizing the dark shadows outside, trying to detect any signs of danger. \n\nHe recalled that the last time the owl had appeared, he had seen Naroka's figure and learned of her death the following day. \n\nI wonder if something similar will happen this time\u2026 But after careful observation, he didn't notice anything abnormal and breathed a sigh of relief. He drew the curtains and lay back on the bed.\n\nIn the deep darkness, Lumian opened his eyes, contemplating his next move.\n\nI wonder what this owl is trying to do\u2026 It's acting so strange and mysterious. It shouldn't be up to anything good\u2026\n\nWhatever. With the situation in the village, I have to leave with Aurore as soon as possible. I don't believe that it can follow us to Trier!\n\nIf I don't receive a reply tomorrow, we'll leave Cordu the morning after tomorrow\u2026\n\nIf there's a reply, we can leave Cordu openly from the village entrance. If not, we'll have to improvise. It's Lent tomorrow, and everyone will still be celebrating the day after tomorrow, so we won't attract too much attention. Aurore can borrow Madame Pualis' pony and spend some time in the nearby alpine pastures. We don't need to go down the mountain, so it shouldn't attract the investigators' attention. When the time comes, we can use a dangerous trail to leave the mountain\u2026\n\nThe path is treacherous, with several broken parts in the middle. Even the shepherds don't think it's passable. However, with my newfound abilities and Aurore's witchcraft, allowing her to fly a distance, she'll have it easier than me\u2026\n\nThere's a good chance we can hoodwink the investigators\u2026\n\nBecoming a Hunter had allowed him to do what was previously impossible. It gave Lumian a newfound sense of confidence, allowing him to quickly formulate a plan.\n\nHis heart became more certain, and he slept soundly.\n\n......\n\nThe next morning, Lumian rose early and got to work in the kitchen. \n\nHis thoughts turned to how he had become a Beyonder and how he was about to leave the abnormal village of Cordu with his sister. Lumian's mood brightened, and he even found himself eager to hum a tune.\n\nWhen Aurore came downstairs, there were already two bowls of minced meat noodles on the table.\n\n\"How did you know I was about to get up?\" she asked, pleased.\n\n\"I started cooking noodles when I heard movement in the washroom.\" Lumian grinned, inwardly noting, You are always in a groggy state after waking up. How don't you realize this?\n\nAurore nodded. As she sat at the dining table, she casually asked, \"That owl flew over again in the middle of the night?\"\n\n\"That's right.\" Lumian knew that his sister had discovered him looking out the window, so the owl's appearance had been a fortunate distraction. Otherwise, he wasn't sure how to explain himself.\n\nHe couldn't risk telling Aurore about his newfound Beyonder abilities just yet, as he would be given a dressing down by her.\n\nHowever, Lumian planned to divulge the truth to his sister sooner than later. He wanted to avoid Aurore from having considerations that might hinder their escape.\n\nHe planned to tell his sister about this the day after tomorrow when they escaped from Cordu to prevent her from diverting her attention to take care of him.\n\nBy then, she wouldn't have the time to give him a dressing down.\n\nAurore furrowed her brow in confusion. \"What a strange owl\u2026\" \n\nShe was still trying to decipher the bird's true intentions\u2014all it did was come over to take a look. \n\nLumian slurped up the last of his noodles, then turned to his sister. \n\n\"If there's a reply, we'll leave Cordu this evening and take the usual path down the mountain. \n\n\"If not, borrow a pony from Madame Pualis tomorrow morning and we'll head to the nearest alpine ranch. I know of a trail that leads down the mountain, and the investigators won't be aware of it.\"\n\nAurore fiddled with her hair, deep in thought. \n\nAfter a while, she grinned and said, \"Sure, the probability of this plan succeeding is quite high.\" \n\nShe clicked her tongue and added, \"My stupid brother has grown up.\" \n\nLumian couldn't help but feel smug, basking in his sister's praise.\n\n......\n\nAfter breakfast, Lumian made an excuse to go see if Ava was finished with her Spring Elf blessings tour. He left the subterranean building and headed straight to Ol' Tavern. \n\nAs a newly-minted Beyonder, Lumian was eager to gain more knowledge, and the lady had promised to share some with him.\n\nNot far from the tavern, Lumian spotted an old acquaintance walking towards him. \n\nIt was Pons B\u00e9net, the younger brother of the local padre. \n\nHe's alone\u2026 Lumian couldn't help but smile at the thought of how he had been chased by Pons and his thugs in the past.\n\nHaving just obtained supernatural powers, he was already eager to test out his new supernatural powers.\n\n\"Hey, my illegitimate son,\" Lumian greeted him. \"How dare you go out alone without daddy's permission?\" \n\nLumian hoped to provoke Pons and goad him into a fight instead of letting him run.\n\nPons B\u00e9net looked in the direction of the voice and saw him.\n\nThe villain's expression changed slightly. He turned to run away. \n\nThud. Thud. Thud\u2026 Lumian watched in disbelief as Pons sprinted away, disappearing at the intersection not far away. \n\nHe sure ran fast\u2026 Quite an alert one\u2026\n\nLumian sighed silently.\n\nHe knew, without a shadow of a doubt, that he could take down Pons B\u00e9net in a one-on-one scrap, even before he ascended to Beyonder status. But it seemed likely that Pons B\u00e9net had the same notion. The two of them had never properly thrown down, but they both had confidence in their own abilities. So, it caught him off guard when Pons B\u00e9net bolted the second he caught sight of him today, like he'd come face to face with a bloodthirsty beast.\n\nIt's impossible for him to know that I secretly became a Beyonder last night\u2026 Is he so dense that he's developed animal instincts and can sniff out danger? Lumian slandered Pons B\u00e9net in his heart.\n\nHe refrained from pursuing Pons B\u00e9net because he regretted the moment he \"greeted\" him.\n\nThe village was riddled with aberrations, and the situation was perilous. Lumian knew better than to stir the pot before he left.\n\nIf he had pummeled Pons B\u00e9net, the padre and his goons might spring into action prematurely, thus jeopardizing his and Aurore's escape. It would be too late for regrets when that happened.\n\nFurthermore, the padre's group was an enigma, and there could be something off about Pons B\u00e9net. Lumian suspected that if he engaged in fisticuffs with him, his Beyonder identity would be exposed, and that would spell trouble in the future.\n\nBeing a Beyonder has made me too haughty and overconfident. I need to rein myself in, Lumian mused, reflecting on his behavior, as he entered Ol' Tavern.\n\nHe had intended to head straight to the second floor, but his eyes landed on the lady seated in the corner.\n\nToday, the lady was garbed in a pearl-gray dress and a light-colored lady's bonnet. Lumian noticed that there wasn't any food in front of her.\n\n\"Have you had breakfast?\" he asked, taking a seat opposite her.\n\nThe lady replied nonchalantly, \"Not yet. I'm meeting someone here, and I'm still waiting for her.\"\n\nHer? Not me\u2026? Lumian scanned the area but saw no one else except the tavern owner.\n\nHe looked at the lady again and sincerely said, \"I've become a Hunter.\"\n\nIt's time for you to keep your promise and give me more common knowledge.\n\nThe lady wasn't surprised at all. She remarked with a smile, \"It seems you're in pretty good shape.\"\n\nShe spoke in a voice that sounded almost otherworldly, \"What you need to master now are two laws and one method.\"\n\nWhy does it feel like I'm studying physics\u2026 Lumian didn't dare speak his thoughts aloud.\n\nThe lady continued to speak, \"For most Beyonders, this knowledge is incredibly valuable. They'd trade everything they have just to acquire it. But for you, fate has brought you here, and so I'll give it to you for free.\"\n\nFree things often come at the most hefty price. How will I pay the price? Lumian felt a weight settle on his shoulders.\n\nEver since he became a Hunter, his intuition and observation skills had improved significantly. He could sense a strange, indescribable emotion in the lady's eyes, much stronger than before, but he still couldn't put a finger on what it was.\n\nThe lady straightened up. \n\n\"All supernatural powers come from the Oldest One, the Creator. As a believer of the Eternal Blazing Sun, you should know that His eyes became the Sun.\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Lumian had heard the padre's sermons about it before.\n\n\"That's a symbolic description,\" the lady clarified. \"In essence, the Oldest One created this world and many deities. Eventually, He disintegrated Himself and split into Beyonder characteristics of different pathways.\"\n\n\"So that's why they're called the paths of the divine?\" Lumian connected the dots.\n\nThe lady nodded slightly.\n\n\"Yes, every pathway's Sequence 0 is equivalent to a true god. For instance, the Bard pathway's Sequence 0 is known as the Sun, which is also the Eternal Blazing Sun you believe in.\"\n\nLumian was surprised and a little apprehensive. So every Beyonder can become a god in the end?\n\nIf he were a devout believer of the Eternal Blazing Sun, he would have accused the lady of blasphemy. But he wasn't that kind of person. He was just a casual believer who didn't give it much thought.\n\nHe even asked, \"What's the Hunter pathway's Sequence 0? And what about the Mystery Pryer pathway?\"\n\n\"Didn't I already tell you? It's the Red Priest, and the position is currently vacant,\" the lady replied with a chuckle. \"As for the Mystery Pryer pathway, the Sequence 0 is known as The Hermit, and it's currently occupied by an evil god called the Hidden Sage. He likes to impart knowledge to Beyonders of the same pathway, earning Him the nickname 'Knowledge Pursuer.' Your sister's troubles stem from Him.\"\n\n\"Is that so\u2026\" Lumian felt a twinge of dislike towards the Hidden Sage.\n\nThe woman redirected the conversation. \n\n\"Since Beyonder characteristics come from the Oldest One, they won't disappear or increase. They only transform from one form to another, moving from one object to another. This is known as the Law of Beyonder Characteristics Indestructibility or the Law of Conservation.\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 8": "The idea hit Lumian like a bolt of lightning, but he didn't particularly fancy going through with it.\n\nIgnoring the fact that years had flown by since the Warlock's demise and that the lifespan of owls was measly compared to humans, the sheer number of birds in the mountain was enough to make Lumian reconsider.\n\nThere were too many of the damn things!\n\nThat owl doesn't have any distinct markings\u2026 No, in the legends, there was no mention of anything specific about the owl. Naroka didn't disclose everything\u2026 We didn't inquire deeply enough... He snapped out of his thoughts and flashed a reassuring smile at Reimund.\n\n\"An owl tied to a Warlock could live for a hundred years.\" \n\nAs Reimund trembled with fear, he reassured him in a calm voice, \"Don't fret, mon ami. This is my last resort. I do not wish to encounter a monster.\"\n\n\"Perhaps we should consult another old sage. Naroka may have overlooked a vital clue.\"\n\nThe man's tone turned seductive as he continued, \"If I were a Warlock, I would not keep all my treasures with me or in my home. I would stash some away in case the Inquisition attacked me. I would not have the luxury of time to collect my belongings. When I must flee, I would be left destitute.\"\n\nThe Inquisition of the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun was notorious for hunting down Warlocks and Witches. Their \"heroic deeds\" were celebrated throughout the countryside.\n\nReimund's face lit up with excitement as he exclaimed, \"You are right!\"\n\nHe said with a yearning expression, \"It's a shame. Too many years have elapsed. The Church's discovered riches must have been spent ages ago.\"\n\n\"Mon ami, that's a dangerous thought,\" Lumian teased.\n\nUndeterred, they continued their visits to Pierre-p\u00e8re, Naferia, and other elders of the Maury family.\n\nAlthough their responses mirrored Naroka's, Lumian and Reimund, with their newfound experience, managed to extract more details.\n\nFor instance, the owl was of medium size and resembled its kind. It had a pointed beak, a feline face, brown feathers with scattered spots, brownish-yellow eyes, and black pupils\u2026\n\nHowever, it was larger than the average owl, and its eyes appeared to spin. It was not as rigid or dim-witted as its kind.\n\nAll these peculiarities made the owl seem even more sinister in their descriptions.\n\n\"Seems like we've hit a dead end,\" Lumian stated to Reimund as they traveled to the townsquare. \"We must focus on other legends.\"\n\nReimund was not as discouraged as he had been earlier. \"Agreed. But which one should we pursue?\"\n\nThis fellow is so proactive and hardworking\u2026 Lumian silently praised Reimund's enthusiasm and diligence and readied a reward for him.\n\nHe nodded and said, \"Take your time and reflect on it. We shall discuss tomorrow. I shall impart combat techniques to you this afternoon.\"\n\n\"Marvelous!\" Reimund exclaimed, overjoyed by the unforeseen instruction.\n\nAurore was a skilled fighter. After all, how else could she handle the savage and rough men in the village? Her younger brother was likely to be just as proficient.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to Reimund Greg, Lumian veered onto the trail leading to his home.\n\nAs he walked, he spotted a group of men approaching him.\n\nThe leader was in his prime, not towering above 1.7 meters in height. He wore a white robe and had light black hair.\n\nWith a regal demeanor and decent facial features, the tip of his nose curled slightly in undisguised disgust and malice as he glared at Lumian with his blue eyes.\n\nNone other than the padre of the Eternal Blazing Sun Church in Cordu, Guillaume B\u00e9net.\n\n\"I have been awaiting your arrival for quite some time,\" Guillaume B\u00e9net bellowed in a baritone voice. \"Did you deliberately bring those foreigners to the cathedral?\"\n\nLumian attempted to explain himself as he furtively took a step back. \"I thought you were sleeping inside.\"\n\nHe had noticed Pons B\u00e9net\u2014the padre's younger sibling\u2014standing beside Guillaume B\u00e9net. Pons was in his early thirties, muscular, domineering, and a bully. \n\nThe other individuals with them were the padre's henchmen.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net signaled Pons with a glance as Lumian retreated.\n\nPons B\u00e9net's grin turned sinister as he lunged forward, bellowing, \n\n\"Rascal, eet ees time zat you learn who ees ze father here!\"\n\nBefore he could complete his sentence, Pons had already hastened his steps and pounced on Lumian. The other brutes followed suit.\n\nIn Cordu, a place where logic held no sway and apologies fell on deaf ears, brute force was the only language that could command respect. Guillaume B\u00e9net, the padre, knew this all too well, having resorted to violence countless times before. So, when he learned that the outsiders had been ushered into the cathedral by Lumian, the priest wasted no time in making his move. He was determined to get hold of the ruffian and pummel him into submission until he lay bedridden for a month. The padre was keen to show Lumian the error of his ways and wouldn't rest until someone paid the price for his insolence.\n\nOf course, he had to avoid Aurore.\n\nRegarding the law, he only needed to notify the administrator and the territory judge, B\u00e9ost. The city sheriffs were unlikely to investigate such a minor issue in the countryside.\n\nAs an outsider, B\u00e9ost would not offend a local-born padre unless there was significant conflict of interest.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net felt fortunate that the foreigners had not divulged his affair with Madame Pualis, the administrator's wife, to anyone. He was still unaware of this.\n\nDespite their speed, Lumian was quicker. Just as Pons spoke, Lumian pivoted and dashed away.\n\nHe was familiar with the padre's character and methods.\n\nPreviously, a villager had accused Guillaume B\u00e9net of having multiple mistresses and embezzling offerings from the Eternal Blazing Sun. He had also bullied others relentlessly in the village, hardly behaving like a man of the cloth. Subsequently, the villager had mysteriously died one afternoon.\n\nThud thud thud!\n\nLumian raced like the wind.\n\n\"Wait for your papa, eh? Attends ton p\u00e8re!\" Pons shouted while chasing him. His pace was not sluggish either.\n\nThe thugs pursued closely behind him.\n\nInstead of fleeing along the main road, Lumian darted into the nearest house.\n\nThe family was preparing lunch in the kitchen when they suddenly saw a stranger burst in.\n\nWith a swoosh, Lumian darted past them and leaped out of the kitchen window at the back.\n\nBy the time Pons and his cronies entered, the homeowner had regained his senses. He stood up to confront them and inquired, \"What is going on? What are all of you doing?\"\n\n\"Get out of ze way, old man!\" Pons shoved the homeowner aside with force, but it slowed him down.\n\nWhen they reached the window and jumped out, Lumian had already vanished into another trail.\n\nAfter pursuing him for a while, they lost sight of Lumian entirely.\n\n\"Sacrebleu, ces chiens fous!\" Pons spat on the roadside.\n\n...\n\nOutside the semi-subterranean two-story abode, Lumian gasped for breath before finally opening the door and entering the house as though nothing had happened.\n\n\"One, two, three, four; two, two, three, four\u2026\" A series of rhythmic shouts reverberated in his ears.\n\nLumian gazed at the empty space on the other side of the kitchen and observed Aurore's blond hair tied in a ponytail. She wore a flaxen shirt, tight white pants, and dark sheepskin boots, leaping around and drenched in sweat.\n\nIn Cordu, the kitchen occupied most of the space on the first floor, serving as the family's core. Cooking and dining occurred here, as did receiving guests.\n\nShe's exercising again\u2026 Lumian was accustomed to Aurore's eccentricities and was unfazed by her exercise regimen.\n\nAurore often did strange things without giving any reason when probed.\n\nAt the very least, exercising is beneficial, and it's quite a feast for the eyes\u2026 Lumian observed silently.\n\nAfter a while, Aurore stopped and squatted to turn off the black tape recorder. \n\nShe took the white towel from Lumian and instructed him as she wiped the sweat from her forehead, \n\n\"Remember, we have combat practice this afternoon.\"\n\n\"I have to study and learn combat. Aren't you demanding too much of me?\" Lumian grumbled nonchalantly.\n\nAurore glanced at him, smiling, and retorted, \"You must remember that our objective is the comprehensive development of the five educations<span tabindex=\"1\">1 of morality, intellect, physique, aesthetics, and labor!\"\n\nThe more she spoke, the happier she became, as if recollecting something beautiful or amusing.\n\nI have already failed moral education\u2026 Lumian muttered under his breath.\n\nHe queried, \"What kind of combat?\"\n\nOne of the things he failed to comprehend was that Aurore, who seemed delicate and frail, was an expert in combat. She mastered numerous fighting techniques and could easily overpower him.\n\nAurore pondered seriously, leaned forward slightly, and gazed into Lumian's eyes.\n\nShe then laughed heartily and declared, \"Self-defense!\"\n\n\"Huh?\" Lumian exclaimed in astonishment. \"Isn't that supposed to be for girls?\"\n\nAurore stood tall and shook her head gravely, saying sincerely, \"Boys must protect themselves when they are out. Who says boys don't encounter perverts?\"\n\nThe smile on her lips was no longer hidden.\n\nLumian was unsure if his sister was joking or serious, so he remained silent as he retrieved the white towel and headed towards the stairs.\n\nSuddenly, he felt something tighten under his foot, as if he had tripped over an obstacle. He stumbled forward.\n\nIn midair, Lumian hastily contracted his abs, extended his arm, and leaned on the chair beside him. He somersaulted and barely landed on his feet.\n\nAurore retracted her leg and chuckled.\n\n\"One of the fundamental combat principles is to be vigilant at all times. One cannot be complacent. \n\n\"Remember that, my novice brother?\"\n\nHer right hand had already clutched Lumian's back, but when she saw that he had regained control of his body, she let go.\n\n\"It's because I trust you too much\u2026\" Lumian grumbled.\n\nHe contemplated the matter and realized that this trust was meaningless. He had lost count of how many times he had been at the mercy of Aurore.\n\nAurore coughed and restrained her expression.\n\n\"How did it go with that woman?\"\n\nLumian provided a brief summary of their conversation before declaring, \"I intend to wait for your friends to respond before delving into the dream.\"\n\n\"Smart decision,\" Aurore affirmed.\n\nLumian changed the subject. \n\n\"What's for lunch?\"\n\n\"We still have some leftover toast from this morning. I'll roast four more lamb chops for you,\" Aurore replied after contemplating for a moment.\n\n\"What about you?\" Lumian inquired.\n\nAurore casually said, \"I'll just have truffle bamboo chicken shreds topped with some cheese and onion soup. I tried it last time and found it to be quite\u2026\"\n\nBefore she could finish speaking, she suddenly froze.\n\nThe next moment, she raised her hands to cover her ears. The muscles on her face gradually contorted, making her appear somewhat ferocious.\n\nLumian observed silently, his eyes filled with anxiety and apprehension.\n\nAfter a while, Aurore exhaled deeply and returned to her usual self.\n\nHer forehead was drenched in sweat once more.\n\n\"What happened?\" Lumian asked.\n\nAurore smiled and responded, \"The ringing in my ears is acting up again. You know that I have this old problem.\"\n\nLumian didn't probe further. Instead, he said, \"Alright, then I'll prepare lunch. Rest well.\"\n\nEvery time this occurred, his yearning for extraordinary abilities grew stronger, as it became a pressing matter.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 9": "As the night settled in, Lumian finished dealing with his neighbors who had come to borrow the oven. He made his way up to the second floor, entering the room that served as Aurore's study.\n\nIn Cordu, many folks were destitute and couldn't afford their own ovens or large stoves. When they needed to toast bread or smoke meat, they had to borrow it from others and use it on the spot.\n\nAurore had always been lenient and accommodating when it came to this. Anyone could borrow her oven, but they had to pay the fuel costs or bring their own coal and wood.\n\nCurrently, she had donned her white silk nightdress and was curled up in a reclining chair, her focus solely on the book she held under the bright battery-powered lamp on the desk.\n\nLumian didn't wish to disturb her, so he nonchalantly pulled out a thinner book from the bookshelf and took a seat in the corner.\n\nHidden Veil\u2026 What kind of magazine is this? Lumian pondered, gazing at the cover that was adorned with cryptic symbols.\n\nHe swiftly flipped through the pages, and the more he read, the more he was taken aback.\n\nThis magazine delved into the very existence of the human soul. It discussed how all beings had a spirit, and through secret methods of communication between different spirits, one could obtain various kinds of aid.\n\nEven if one wasn't devout, even if they only attended the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral to pray and partake in Mass occasionally, two words couldn't help but flash through Lumian's mind: Sacrilege! Taboo!\n\nAs a Warlock who would undoubtedly be burned at the stake by the Inquisition if her true identity was exposed, it was customary for Aurore to have such books at her residence. However, Lumian could tell that this magazine had received the government's permission for publication!\n\nCan such a thing be openly published?\n\nDidn't they say that publication censorship had always been very strict?\n\nOr is this a fake permit\u2026 Lumian looked up at Aurore and inquired, \"Is this a prohibited magazine?\"\n\nAurore took her eyes off her book and glanced at her brother. She responded in a nonchalant tone, \"In the past, it was underground fiction. Later on, for some reason, it cleared the censors and was officially published. The Eternal Blazing Sun Church actually didn't care and tacitly agreed.\"\n\n\"Fiction?\" Lumian was taken aback by his sister's choice of words.\n\n\"Of course, it's fiction. You're not taking it seriously, are you?\" Aurore laughed. \"If what's written is true, do you think it can still be published? If you follow the method written on it, other than making yourself mentally weak and neurotic, there won't be any additional gains. Yes\u2026 there will occasionally be something real, but without the corresponding ritual language, it'll be a waste of effort no matter how hard you try.\"\n\nThis was the professional evaluation of a Warlock.\n\n\"Alright\u2026\" Lumian couldn't hide his disappointment. \"I just find it strange that this can be published.\"\n\nAurore took a deep breath, her puffed-up cheeks accentuating her pondering.\n\n\"I don't know why either. Perhaps it's because the world has been seeing an influx of supernatural events lately, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to conceal them. The public is becoming more aware of their existence, and the government is slowly easing its grip on such topics. That's why books like these are being published. In Trier, Psychic, Lotus, and Arcane are the most popular magazines. I have them all on my bookshelf. If you want to come up with more realistic stories for the tavern, you should give them a read.\"\n\n\"Oui,\" Lumian responded eagerly, his interest piqued.\n\nSimultaneously, he let out a wistful sigh deep in his heart.\n\nAurore's hoard of books was truly impressive and diverse!\n\nThanks to these tomes and Aurore's occasional elucidations, Lumian\u2014a lad who had forsaken his schooling\u2014had managed to acquire a reasonable comprehension of the world, continent, and nation he called home.\n\nThe world was divided into two great continents, one to the north and one to the south, separated by the treacherous Berserk Sea, where raging hurricanes battered any who dared to sail its waters. But the truly mysterious lands lay to the east and west, on the legendary Eastern and Western Continents. No one had ever set foot there, and some wondered if they even existed at all.\n\nLumian and Aurore lived in the Intis Republic, a land situated in the heart of the Northern Continent. It was a nation bordered by the Fog Sea to the west, the Feysac Empire to the north, and the Hornacis mountain range and the Loen Kingdom to the east. To the south lay the Feynapotter kingdom, Lenburg, and Masin.\n\nThe small countries nestled between the Feynapotter Kingdom and the Loen Kingdom, such as Segar, together with Lenburg and Masin, were collectively known as the countries of the south-central region. They shared a common faith in the God of Knowledge and Wisdom.\n\nThe Southern Continent had already fallen under the dominion of the various powers of the Northern Continent. Whether it was the Balam Empire, the Paz Kingdom, the Haagenti Kingdom, or any of the other nations, they had all but lost their autonomy. Yet still, a fierce resistance against colonization burned in the hearts of the conquered.\n\nIn addition to the Berserk Sea dividing the Northern and Southern Continents, there were other great seas: the Fog Sea to the west of the Intis Republic, the Sonia Sea to the east of the Loen Kingdom, the North Sea to the north of the Feysac Empire, and the Polar Sea to the south of the Southern Continent. They were collectively known as the Five Seas.\n\nOf all the nations of the Northern Continent, the Loen Kingdom was the strongest, with the Intis Republic close behind. The Feysac Empire, defeated in the last war, had fallen to fourth place. The Feynapotter Kingdom had risen to third place. And among the countries of the south-central region, Lenburg reigned supreme.\n\nCompared to the simple folk in Cordu who only knew of the Intis Republic, the Feynapotter kingdom, and Lenburg, Lumian was practically a cartographer.\n\nIt was no surprise really, considering the Cordu Village shepherds only traveled to their neighboring kingdoms of Feynapotter and Lenburg. They only had a limited understanding of these lands. The people in the northern villages of the Dari\u00e8ge region were just as provincial. Other than the surrounding settlements, they could only name Trier, Suhit, and a few other metropolitans.\n\nLumian was often baffled. How did Aurore come by such vast knowledge?\n\nAll the textbooks he read were penned by Aurore, and all his practice exams were prepared by her. Aurore had an answer for every question in the books he read!\n\nBut what stunned him even more was her expertise in various forms of combat.\n\nIt was simply mind-boggling that a woman in her twenties could accumulate so much wisdom. Some people couldn't amass that much knowledge even after living 50 or 60 years.\n\nCould it be that these are the building blocks of a true Warlock? Lumian looked up again and gazed at Aurore, lost in thought.\n\nAs Aurore patted her cheeks while reading, she hardly seemed like a scholar or a warlock.\n\nAurore caught Lumian's gaze and demanded, \"What are you ogling at?\"\n\nLumian quickly changed the subject, \"Last time you mentioned that I possess the knowledge required to pass the college entrance examination?\"\n\nAurore pondered for a moment before responding, \"In theory, you could gain admission to any university, but since I never took that particular exam, I can't say for certain what questions will be asked. Roselle sure did a number on the populace. Sigh, I guess it's a good thing\u2026\"\n\nUndoubtedly, Emperor Roselle's reign spawned the college entrance examination, and it has remained a fixture of academic life to this day.\n\nAurore's mind suddenly shifted gears. She shot Lumian a sly grin and inquired, \"Why did you not make your usual stop at the tavern today to regale the patrons with your tales?\"\n\n\"I'm not truly an alcoholic,\" Lumian replied while flipping through his magazine. \"Reading at home is equally enjoyable.\"\n\nAnd it helps to calm my nerves and ease my mind\u2026 Lumian silently added.\n\nAurore nodded and glanced over at Lumian's spot in the corner of the room.\n\n\"Why are you sitting so far away, putting on an act of pitifulness, weakness, and helplessness?\"\n\n\"Come closer. You need proper lighting to read at night, otherwise, your eyes will suffer.\"\n\nAurore sure has a way with words, Lumian mused. Although I understand the meaning behind \"pitifulness,\" \"weakness,\" and \"helplessness,\" it's still an odd combination. Supposedly used to her idiosyncrasies by now, Lumian retrieved a chair and moved closer to the desk where Aurore sat. \n\nThe two of them spent the evening reading in silence, occasionally chatting, as the sound of their breathing mingled with the rustling of pages and the soft breeze that wafted in from outside the window. Peaceful and soothing.\n\n...\n\nAs he bid Aurore goodnight, Lumian slipped back into his quarters. \n\nHe peeled off his coat and draped it across the back of the chair. He couldn't risk bringing the Wand card to bed with him; that would only raise suspicion, and his sister had sworn to keep a watchful eye on him at all times.\n\nJust as he was about to approach the bed, Lumian froze, his heart skipping a beat. \n\nHis sharp eyes darted around the room, and he adjusted the chair that was usually positioned at a diagonal angle to face the window.\n\nThen, he crawled into bed and extinguished the kerosene lamp resting on the cabinet next to him.\n\nAs he drifted off into the depths of slumber, Lumian was suddenly startled awake.\n\nThe bedroom was shrouded in a dense, gray fog.\n\nLumian, who was already mentally prepared, calmly took in his surroundings and made a realization.\n\nThe chair that he had meticulously arranged before retiring for the night was still positioned at an angle in his dream, just as it had been in reality in the past.\n\nThis suggested that the dream world he had entered was not an exact reflection of reality. Perhaps it was a manifestation of his deepest subconscious desires. Although Lumian couldn't decipher its meaning, he knew that it was something to be remembered.\n\nHe walked over to the window, placed his hands on the sill, and gazed out.\n\nThe mountain made of brownish-red stones and reddish-brown soil, and the collapsed buildings that surrounded it, were still present.\n\nThe eerie silence of the place was deafening.\n\nTime quickly passed. After much contemplation, Lumian made a firm decision.\n\nHe would embark on a preliminary exploration of the area tonight!\n\nHis past life on the streets had turned him into a man of action. \n\nHe didn't rush downstairs, however. Instead, he opened the cabinet and began to pile on clothes. \n\nHe didn't need them to keep warm, but he wanted to increase his \"defense ability\" in this way. \n\nHe grabbed a cotton shirt, cotton pants, and a leather jacket, stretching his body to feel the fit. Any more clothing would only hinder his agility, and that was crucial in a situation like this.\n\nAs he adjusted to his current state, Lumian had a sudden thought. \n\nThis is my dream. Can't I get whatever I want?\n\nWith that intention, he muttered to himself, \"I want a breastplate and a revolver\u2026 I want a breastplate and a revolver\u2026\"\n\nThe room was still shrouded in a thin, gray fog.\n\nThis won't do. This dream is special\u2026 His disappointment was palpable, but he quickly regained his composure and made his way to the bedroom door. Stepping out into the corridor, he found himself in complete darkness. It was murky and dim.\n\nLumian pushed open the door to Aurore's bedroom and then her study. The layout was slightly different from reality, but he recognized it immediately. The biggest difference, of course, was that Aurore was nowhere to be found. The entire scene was frozen in shades of gray.\n\nThe first floor was no different. \n\nLumian scanned his surroundings, searching for a weapon to defend himself. He knew his home better than anyone else and quickly found two viable options.\n\nThe first was a two-meter-long fork made of steel. Aurore had said that it was effective and outstanding as long as the target didn't have a long-range weapon.\n\nThe second was a sharp, iron-black hand axe.\n\nAh, why not both\u2026 Lumian couldn't help but think of Aurore's oft-repeated phrase, but he quickly dismissed the idea. \n\nToday was all about reconnaissance. He needed to be sly, hidden in the shadows.\n\nLugging around a cumbersome weapon would only hinder his movements and give him away.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Lumian stooped down to retrieve the axe. \n\nHe rose to his full height and set off towards the door, barely visible in the misty haze.\n\nWith a deft hand, he opened the door, not making a sound.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 10": "The azure sky was speckled with fluffy white clouds, gently blown by the spring breeze that carried with it the fragrance of the forest. White geese pecked at the lush grasses, grazing beside the meandering river. A lass, draped in a grayish-white frock, stood intently observing them with a long pole in her hand.\n\nHer countenance was bathed in the golden sun rays, exposing her thin, downy hair. The girl's brown tresses, elegantly tied in a white cloth, revealed her youthful and lively features.\n\nGlancing at Lumian sitting under a tree by the river, Ava Lizier scrunched her face slightly.\n\n\"Are we not here to discuss which legend is easier to investigate? Why have you turned into a stone statue reminiscent of the ones from the cathedral?\"\n\nAva was the daughter of Guillaume Lizier, the shoemaker. Being one of the few youths in the village, she had an amiable relationship with Lumian and Reimund.\n\n\"I'm contemplating a problem,\" Lumian responded, still gazing at the white geese and the rippling waters.\n\n\"What problem?\" inquired Reimund Greg, who was tending to Ava's flock of geese.\n\nLumian pondered before replying, \"What if you come across a beast with a thick hide that your weapon cannot pierce, what would you do?\"\n\n\"Obviously, I'd find a way to flee. The mountains are teeming with wild beasts. We need not hunt it,\" Ava replied, feeling that there was nothing to worry about.\n\nLumian grunted in disagreement.\n\n\"What if that beast is exceptionally rare, and the lords in the city adore it, and are willing to pay a hundred Louis d'or for its carcass?\"\n\n\"A hundred Louis d'or, two thousand verl d'or\u2026\" Reimund breathed heavily.\n\nHe had never seen a Louis d'or before, nor had he used one. His instinct was to convert it into verl d'or first.\n\nWith such a hefty sum of money, he could start a small business in Dari\u00e8ge. He wouldn't have to fret over shepherding anymore.\n\nHe quickly thought and suggested, \"Borrow a shotgun?\"\n\n\"The beast's skin cannot be penetrated,\" Lumian rejected flatly.\n\nEven though she knew the prey was just a figment of imagination, with no value in the real world, she couldn't help herself.\n\n\"Is it a powerful creature? Fierce?\"\n\nLumian paused to consider her question.\n\n\"It's about as fierce as me.\" \n\nThat was all the assurance he needed to continue his hunt.\n\nReimund, who had been holding his breath, let out a sigh of relief. \"Good. Go back to the village and round up some people. We'll surround the beast and drain its strength. Once it's down, we'll tie it up.\"\n\nHe knew that Lumian could fight, but that was all.\n\n\"In that case, we can only expect to get ten Louis d'or, or even less,\" Lumian reminded.\n\nAva, with her stunning lake-blue eyes, had an idea. \"I've seen them hunt before. Maybe we can dig a trap and make it fall. That way, we won't have to worry about it getting back up.\"\n\nLumian nodded his approval. \"That's a good idea.\"\n\nRealizing that Ava and Reimund had little to offer in terms of planning, Lumian took control of the conversation.\n\n\"Which legend do you think we should target next?\" he asked.\n\nAva shook her head. \"Neither of them fit the bill. They're either centuries old or were only seen by one person, who is long dead.\"\n\nReimund agreed. \"That's right.\"\n\n\"If you don't ask the right folks, how would you know there ain't no clues?\" Lumian clicked his tongue and chuckled. \"You lot don't have any grit. If you wanna give up at the first sign of trouble, you might as well be tending geese and sheep for the rest of your days.\"\n\nAva and Reimund were fuming at Lumian's words.\n\nWhen it came to riling people up, Lumian was one of the best in all of Cordu.\n\nAva blurted out, \"I don't think any of them are suitable 'cause there are more suitable ones.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Lumian's eyes sparked with interest.\n\nAs soon as Ava spoke, she regretted it, but she'd been planning to bring up this issue. She just didn't want to reveal it to Lumian and Reimund so easily.\n\nAfter a few seconds of tense silence, she glared at Lumian.\n\n\"There's a real witch in the village.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Lumian's heart tightened.\n\nCould it be Aurore?\n\nIf Ava found out that Aurore was a Warlock, he and Aurore would have to flee Cordu and go somewhere else to avoid the Inquisition's wrath.\n\nAva looked around nervously and lowered her voice. \"Madame Pualis.\"\n\nMadame Pualis, the administrator's wife and the padre's mistress? Lumian found it hard to believe.\n\n\"Are you serious?\"\n\nIf Pualis was indeed a witch, how could Lumian have missed it when he found out about the lady's affair with the padre?\n\n\"No way?\" Reimund was exceptionally surprised.\n\nAva tiptoed and looked in the direction of the village entrance.\n\n\"I'm not certain, but Charlie, the administrator's valet, let it slip once.\n\n\"He told me that Madame Pualis is a soul messenger who can talk to the dead and help them return home. He also said that she can create secret medicines and charms.\"\n\nLumian listened intently but remained skeptical. \n\nWith magazines like Psychic, Lotus, and Concealed Veil flooding the market, it wasn't uncommon for the administrator's wife to be familiar with such terms and trick the servants and villagers.\n\n\"We should go to the cathedral and snitch,\" said Reimund, his eyes wide with excitement.\n\nLumian paused before responding, \n\n\"If Charlie knows that Madame Pualis is a witch, then the administrator should know as well, non?\"\n\n\"Oui,\" agreed Ava.\n\nLumian continued, \"Madame Pualis is also the padre's mistress. If we go to the cathedral and snitch on her, we will probably be sent straight to the administrator.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Madame Pualis is the padre's mistress?\"\n\nAva and Reimund were shocked.\n\n\"I saw it with my own eyes.\" Lumian chuckled. \"Pretend you don't know. Don't tell anyone. Otherwise, you might disappear one day.\"\n\nAva and Reimund agreed in unison, their expressions unusually solemn, their fear of the padre and the witch intertwined.\n\n\"If we can confirm that Madame Pualis is a witch, we'll go to Dari\u00e8ge and tell the bishop at Mass,\" Lumian assured them.\n\n\"Oui,\" Reimund nodded fervently.\n\nThey had to be sure before they snitched. Otherwise, they would be in trouble if Madame Pualis was innocent.\n\nAfter discussing these matters, Lumian, who didn't want to waste any time, stood up and said to Ava and Reimund, \"I'm off, back to my studies. Otherwise, Aurore would be chasing me with a wooden stick. You two take care of the geese.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Reimund was thrilled at the prospect of being left alone with Ava.\n\nAva looked displeased.\n\n......\n\nAs Lumian approached Cordu, he began to hide his tracks, constantly paying attention to whether there was anyone nearby.\n\nHe had to be careful, especially now that the Padre and his crew were on his tail. \n\nAccording to his observations, the padre, Guillaume B\u00e9net, was not one to forgive easily. \n\nHe made his way towards Ol' Tavern, trying to stay as inconspicuous as possible. \n\nSuddenly, he heard the sound of bells ringing in the distance. \n\nLumian turned to see Ryan, Leah, and Valentine approaching Naroka and the others. \n\nThe bells on Leah's veil and boots rang clearly and melodiously.\n\nThey've been wandering around the village for the past two days, chatting with people and asking questions. I don't know what they are up to\u2026 Lumian was puzzled and a little wary.\n\nAs he thought about the deserted town square and the shepherd, Pierre Berry, who had returned to the village unexpectedly, Lumian knew that something was about to go down. \n\nIs something about to happen in the village? He needed to speak to Aurore, his smart and knowledgeable sister, and get her opinion.\n\nLumian managed to sneak into Ol' Tavern and spotted the woman who had given him the tarot card sitting in her usual spot, eating.\n\nLumian leaned over and took a glance.\n\n\"Omelette au lard? Don't you find it a little too cloying?\" \n\nIn Dari\u00e8ge, this dish was the go-to for ordinary folks to impress their fancy guests. Lumian, however, had his doubts about it being too greasy and heavy for city women.\n\nThe lady savored a slow bite of the golden omelet and shut her eyes to savor it.\n\n\"It's a real gem. It's got this local flavor that's just exquisite.\"\n\n\"You're having lunch so early?\" Lumian asked, seated across from her.\n\nThe lady's light-blue eyes betrayed a hint of exhaustion as she smiled and replied, \"It's breakfast.\"\n\nWhat time is it\u2026 Lumian didn't dare let slip his thoughts.\n\nHe scanned the nearly empty Ol' Tavern and hushed his voice.\n\n\"I saw a ruin in my dream and came across a monster.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" The lady didn't bat an eye. Her expression even held a hint of teasing mischief that Lumian couldn't quite decipher.\n\nLumian composed himself and recounted his tale.\n\n\"How do I vanquish this monster?\"\n\nThe lady beamed and countered, \"Is it dead or alive?\"\n\n\"It's still kicking. I can't seem to kill it\u2026\" Lumian trailed off then answered on reflex.\n\nHe pondered in earnest for a beat before replying slowly, \"I can feel it breathing. So, it's gotta be alive.\"\n\n\"If it's still breathing, then try harder. Lop off its head. Or pour oil and light it up. Bury it alive, even. Who knows? It might just kick the bucket,\" the lady suggested nonchalantly while relishing her meal. \"When you've exhausted all options and still come up short, then come to me. But I'm not your nanny who'll coddle you through every little problem. If you want to learn, you've got to figure it out on your own.\"\n\nShe's quite the charmer\u2026 Lumian wasn't crestfallen or dispirited. It seemed the lady was hinting that she'd lend a hand if things got truly dire. And a monster like this wasn't even worth mentioning.\n\nBut what's trivial can be a real headache\u2026 Lumian felt a migraine coming on.\n\nHe resolved to heed the lady's advice. He'd start by trying to behead it, burn it, bury it alive, and anything else he could think of.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 11": "As Lumian left Ol' Tavern, he resumed his surreptitious ways, skulking down the path he always took home.\n\nSure enough, he spotted one of Pons B\u00e9net's goons hiding behind a tree, spying on passersby.\n\nThe padre doesn't know when to quit\u2026 Lumian muttered to himself.\n\nBut Lumian couldn't retaliate. \n\nHis personal abilities were limited, and he couldn't risk bringing attention from the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun in the Dari\u00e8ge region. The Inquisition would be all over him in a heartbeat, which could spell doom for Aurore.\n\nUnless Lumian was pushed to the brink and had no other choice but to abandon the town, his only option was to expose the padre's unsavory activities and force him to retire to a cloister.\n\nBut that was easier said than done. Lumian needed to be careful and cunning, just like when he let the foreigners discover the padre's affair with Madame Pualis.\n\nLumian didn't want to make a big fuss about it. He knew that B\u00e9ost, the administrator and territorial judge, was a stickler for his reputation. If Lumian brought Madame Pualis's predicament to light, he wouldn't get any favors in return. No, it would be more likely that B\u00e9ost would turn on him, filled with bile and vitriol.\n\nThat would leave Lumian with little choice but to flee Cordu, with both the padre and administrator hot on his heels.\n\nHe proceeded with caution, taking a detour through a narrow alley that weaved between several houses. \n\nAlong the way, Lumian relied on his wits and the surroundings to conceal himself. He ducked behind walls, slipped through doors, and took refuge behind trees whenever necessary. As he neared the end of the alley, he heard the sound of voices.\n\n\"Guillaume, why we waste our time chasing zat keed all day? Let's go to Aurore's house tonight and catch him. We 'ave ze advantage of numbers, and Aurore's fightin' skills ain't enough to stop us. We can even get reinforcements from ze city if needed.\"\n\nGuillaume\u2026 The padre is here too\u2026 Lumian stopped, retreating into the corner to eavesdrop on their conversation to see what plans the padre had for him.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net's voice was mesmerizing.\n\n\"Surely, you don't think that's the extent of Aurore's capabilities? I wouldn't be surprised if she had supernatural abilities beyond mine.\"\n\n\"Ah\u2026\" Pons B\u00e9net was obviously surprised. \"A witch, you say? Guillaume, maybe it's time for you to venture to Dari\u00e8ge and seek out ze Inquisition. If you can catch a true witch, ze Church will undoubtedly grant you a great reward. And wiz zat, you may finally attain ze extraordinary strength you've been yearnin' for all zese years.\"\n\n\"Imbecile,\" Guillaume B\u00e9net scolded his brother. \"Don't you know what's happening in this village? The Inquisition has noses like hounds. They won't overlook any anomalies. When the time comes, we'll be in hot water.\"\n\n\"Even if Aurore desires to deal with us, I have other solutions,\" he said. \"We mustn't arouse the Inquisition's attention.\"\n\nSo, what is happening in the village now? Lumian took this seriously and was curious.\n\nCombining his observations of abnormalities, he sensed that something terrible was brewing and developing in the village, like a turbulent undercurrent under the calm sea.\n\nTo Lumian's dismay, Pons B\u00e9net didn't elaborate on the topic. Instead, he focused on something else.\n\n\"Do you 'ave any way to deal wiz a Witch?\"\n\n\"You don't need to know,\" the padre, Guillaume B\u00e9net, responded in a hushed tone. \"Next, we can put aside dealing with Lumian, but we still have to maintain appearances. We can't let anyone suspect my desire for revenge. That will provide the connections the foreigners need and have a negative impact. What you need to do now is to remind each relevant person and scare those yokels who might notice. Don't let them spill the beans in front of those foreigners.\"\n\n\"Guillaume, you mean zat zose foreigners are 'ere to investigate zat matter?\" Pons B\u00e9net appeared fearful and concerned.\n\nLook at you. All brawn, no brains. You're nothing like your brother, a natural-born leader\u2026 Lumian mocked Pons B\u00e9net inwardly.\n\nDespite his disdain for the padre, whom he saw as a crude and greedy stallion rather than a man of the cloth, Lumian couldn't deny that he had a certain rugged charm. His direct, domineering style and clear mind won over the masses in the countryside, making it easy for them to idolize and rely on him.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net sneered.\n\n\"No need to worry. So long as those foreigners don't find any real evidence, I'll still be the padre of Cordu.\n\n\"Pons, you need to understand that ruling through fear and intimidation won't lead to peace or prosperity. The Church doesn't want a ruined town that can't pay taxes. We need friends and followers to maintain control. By offering them protection, we can gain their support.\n\n\"The Church trusts us locals with our relatives, friends, and followers to handle matters here and doesn't bring in outsiders who could make a mess. As long as there's no solid evidence, the higher-ups will continue to believe in me.\n\n\"Alright, I'm off to the cathedral.\"\n\nThat does sound logical and persuasive, but your wisdom and insight are limited to Dari\u00e8ge\u2026 Aurore told me that when the Church confronts villages that are overrun with evil gods, they obliterate them entirely and raze the land to the ground. They don't just slay the adults, but even the kids\u2026 Lumian found himself almost swayed by Guillaume B\u00e9net's words. Luckily, Aurore had warned him about the fearsome reputation of the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun and the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.\n\nAfter the padre departed, Lumian took a different path and made it back home unscathed.\n\nAurore, clad in a pristine apron, bustled about the oven.\n\n\"What are you up to?\" Lumian inquired with curiosity.\n\nIt was still two hours to lunchtime.\n\nAurore tucked a strand of her blonde locks behind her ear and beamed, \"Trying out a new toast recipe. Rice bread.\"\n\n\"You don't have to go through all this trouble\u2026\" Lumian was moved to his core.\n\nHe believed Aurore was going out of her way to make something special just for him.\n\nAurore giggled and retorted, \"What are you thinking? Can you be any more self-absorbed?\"\n\n\"For me, baking is a form of amusement. It's a great way to pass the time. You get it?\"\n\n\"Then why don't you like going out? There's plenty of fun out there,\" Lumian probed. He always felt Aurore was a homebody because she was too concerned about the risks her Warlock status posed.\n\nAurore swiveled her head and shot him a withering glare.\n\n\"You mean drinking and gambling?\"\n\n\"Remember, I'm my own person, not relying on or attaching to others.\"\n\nLumian grasped the first half of her statement but was at a loss with the latter.\n\n\"Ah? Could you expound on that?\"\n\nAurore gave him a deadly glare.\n\n\"Long story short, your sis is a major introvert most of the time!\"\n\n\"What do you mean by most of the time?\" Lumian queried, confused.\n\n\"Humans are walking contradictions,\" Aurore mused, turning back to the oven. \"Don't you recall? Sometimes, I'm a chatterbox, eager to venture out and listen to the old ladies' gossip. Other times, I'll play with the kids and regale them with tales. Every so often, I'll cut loose and ride Madame Pualis' horse around the mountains, hollering at the top of my lungs.\"\n\nAt the time, you shone like a dew-kissed rose, luring people in only to prick them\u2026 Lumian couldn't help but grumble to himself.\n\nSince Madame Pualis was mentioned, Lumian decided to change the subject.\n\n\"Aurore, uh, Grande Soeur, I heard a rumor about Madame Pualis.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Aurore did not hide her curiosity.\n\n\"She's a Warlock who can talk to the dead\u2026\" Lumian related to his sister what Ava had divulged. He also brought up the anomaly he'd observed and Guillaume B\u00e9net's comments.\n\nAurore halted her work and listened to her brother's account intently.\n\nHer mien grew noticeably graver.\n\nAfter Lumian had finished, Aurore offered him a smile and assuaged his fears.\n\n\"Don't fret too much. Those three foreigners must be here for something that the padre and his comrades did in secret. It might have to do with Madame Pualis.\n\n\"Don't mess with Madame Pualis for now. I'll keep an eye on them.\n\n\"Explore the village more, mingle with those foreigners, and try to suss out what's going on. Heh heh, compared to that, the lady who gave you the Wand card is far more intriguing.\n\n\"If things do deteriorate, we must contemplate departing Cordu. We can start making arrangements now.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Lumian nodded in agreement.\n\nAfter a brief silence, he inquired curiously, \"Aurore, if we must depart Cordu, where do you envision moving to?\"\n\n\"Trier!\" Aurore declared without hesitation.\n\nTrier was the capital of the Intis Republic, the apex of culture and art across the continent.\n\n\"Why?\" Despite considering Trier himself, Lumian posed the question casually.\n\nEvery Intisian coveted a chance to visit Trier.\n\nIn the eyes of the Triers, there were only two types of individuals in Intis: Triers and outsiders.\n\nAurore responded nonchalantly, \"A prophet once said, 'As long as Trier endures, mirth and glee will never falter<span tabindex=\"1\">1.'\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 14": "After a bout of searching, Lumian stumbled upon a considerable number of gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins. In total, there were 197 verl d'or and 25 coppet.\n\nAmong them, Louis d'or alone constituted five.\n\nAs for the paper bills, he only discovered some suspected remnants.\n\nAside from money, Lumian also discovered a small blue book.\n\nThe book had a grayish-blue cover and measured approximately 21 by 28.5 centimeters, a typical size found in Intis villages and towns.\n\nIt was based on the calendar and blended with the religious teachings of the two major Churches. It had a rather positive effect on guiding farmers and herders to farm, produce, and graze to enrich their spiritual lives.\n\nNaturally, even though it had been nearly two centuries since Emperor Roselle advocated compulsory education, there were still a large number of farmers, herdsmen, and workers who knew no more than a handful of words and were illiterate. They could only rely on the explanations of certain people around them to obtain the instructions they needed from the blue book, literally known as livre bleu.\n\nLumian flipped through a few pages nonchalantly and realized that the livre bleu was no different from his own. It was just that it appeared a little older overall.\n\nThere's the livre bleu and so much verl d'or; this family is undoubtedly well-to-do in the countryside. There aren't more than five such families in Cordu\u2026 Lumian discarded the livre bleu and placed the gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins into different pockets. Some were stashed deep in the cotton shirt's pocket, some were tucked into his pants pocket, and some were haphazardly stuffed into the pocket of his leather jacket.\n\nEven though Lumian knew that this wealth couldn't be brought to reality, he couldn't resist collecting it for safekeeping.\n\nThese little trinkets of gold, silver, or copper were simply irresistible.\n\nDuring his days as a vagrant, he cherished every coin he came across, even if it was just a coppet or a lick. He often fought with others for them and took risks to obtain them.\n\nAfter scouting the area, Lumian hoisted his axe and crept towards the collapsed building closer to the reddish-brown mountain peak.\n\nHe proceeded deeper and deeper. Every time he traversed the empty space in the center of the ring, he was apprehensive that dozens of monsters would suddenly ambush him in an area without cover.\n\nIn the faint gray fog, Lumian crouched down and sneaked behind a half-collapsed stone wall. He squatted there and utilized it to conceal his form.\n\nHe cautiously poked his head out and surveyed the area ahead.\n\nIt was a narrow strip between two rows of destroyed buildings. There were no trees, no weeds, just gravel, crevices, and dirt.\n\nSuddenly, a figure jumped into Lumian's line of sight.\n\nIt stood in the opposing building, staring at something.\n\nThis figure was garbed in a black robe with a hood. From the back, there was nothing peculiar. It appeared to be an ordinary human.\n\nLumian's heart constricted as he became even more watchful.\n\nIn such a dream ruin, the appearance of a regular person was far more terrifying than the appearance of a monster!\n\nAs if sensing that someone was observing him, the figure swiveled around slowly.\n\nLumian snuck a quick glance before retracting his head hastily. He leaned against the wall and didn't dare to budge.\n\nWith just one look, he had the impression that he had descended into hell or an abyss.\n\nThe figure was indeed a human, but 'he' had three faces and six eyes!\n\nThe face in front had cloudy eyes, sparse eyebrows, and numerous wrinkles. He was evidently an old man.\n\nThe left side was a chiseled face with sharp-looking blue eyes and a thick, black beard, making him appear like a burly man.\n\nThe skin on the right side was smooth and delicate, like a peeled egg. The blue eyes exuded obvious innocence and ignorance. It didn't seem a day over five years of age.\n\nWhat kind of monster is this\u2026 Lumian attempted to regulate his breathing to prevent his heart from racing.\n\nSuch a monster had never surfaced, even in Aurore's horror tales. Only in the deepest and most absurd nightmares could it be encountered.\n\nAlthough it was not good to judge a 'person' by their appearance, Lumian instinctively sensed that the three-faced monster was far more powerful than the skinless monster from earlier!\n\nFurthermore, there was a high probability that it had exceptional abilities.\n\nEternal Blazing Sun. Great Father, please protect me from being discovered by it\u2026 Upon witnessing this scene, Lumian couldn't help but pray to the Eternal Blazing Sun.\n\nIf he weren't still clutching an axe in one hand and was in a perilous environment, he would have extended his arms, a gesture symbolizing the adoration of the sun.\n\nAt that moment, time appeared to stand still. Lumian believed he might be hallucinating.\n\nIt was as if someone's stare pierced through the wall and landed on his back.\n\nHis back stiffened instantly and felt somewhat warm.\n\nIn just a second or two, the illusion vanished, and heavy footsteps receded into the distance.\n\nLumian waited a while until the footsteps dissipated completely. Then, he gradually straightened his knees, turned around, and poked his head out to survey the area ahead.\n\nThe monster was farther away, having arrived behind the collapsed building whose two sides still stood. Half of its body was visible in the faint gray mist.\n\nIt still had his back to Lumian, as though it had transformed into a statue.\n\nLumian breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nHe didn't have the confidence to confront such a monster.\n\nIt's definitely impossible to venture deeper into the ruins from here\u2026 Should I circumvent it?\n\nWon't there be comparable monsters elsewhere?\n\nThe closer I approach that mountain peak, the more potent the monsters that emerge?\n\nLumian retracted his body and deliberated for a while before deciding to conclude the night.\n\nHe intended to inquire with the woman who gave him the tarot card after daybreak to see if there was a means of dealing with the three-faced monster. If there was no alternative, he would consider taking a detour.\n\nHe arched his back, detached from the wall, and headed in the direction he came from.\n\nAt that moment, he had a notion.\n\nIf I slumber in these ruins, will I be able to escape the dream?\n\nConsidering the possibility of numerous monsters in the vicinity, he suppressed the urge to experiment, for now.\n\nOn the way back, he hastily searched every destroyed building he passed, but he couldn't unearth any useful written information. There were only a few coins.\n\nAfter retreating for a while, Lumian conceived a notion and decided to take a detour. He approached the burnt-out house that he encountered first from the side, where he had buried the skinless monster.\n\nHe wanted to see if the monster's demise would be detected by its kin and if it would result in any changes.\n\nAfter locating the spot and concealing himself, Lumian poked his head out from the side and scrutinized the target area.\n\nIn the following moment, he caught sight of another \"figure.\"\n\nThe figure was half-human and half-beast. Its legs were bent forward as it squatted there and inspected the skinless monster's cadaver.\n\nIt had already removed the stone bricks and wooden blocks that Lumian had stacked.\n\nIt wore a dark jacket and relatively snug muddy pants. Its black hair that hung to its neck was unkempt and greasy, and it carried a shotgun on its back.\n\nA shotgun!\n\nLumian averted his gaze hastily and withdrew his head.\n\nThese monsters are truly absurd!\n\nThey actually know how to wield a shotgun\u2026\n\nAt that moment, Lumian felt like he was a hunter, hunting in the mountains with his weapon and comrades, only to discover that the rabbit opposite him was clutching a water-cooled machine gun and targeting them. He considered it ridiculous and immersion-breaking, as well as disappointing.\n\nAs time elapsed, he waited patiently for the monster with the shotgun to depart.\n\nFinally, he discerned a faint sound of movement, gradually receding.\n\nLumian stuck his head out cautiously once again and examined the monster that was half-human and half-beast.\n\n\"It\" moved like a cat towards the back of the building.\n\nInitially, Lumian's heart eased, but then his eyes widened.\n\nHe realized that the path the monster took was precisely the same as the route he took when he ventured deep into the ruins!\n\nIt's tracking me!\n\nIt has an extraordinary tracking ability!\n\nLumian made a subconscious evaluation.\n\nHe was exceedingly grateful that he had opted for a detour when he returned. Otherwise, he would have certainly collided with it and might have even been ambushed!\n\nAs soon as the monster vanished, Lumian sprang up and dashed towards his house.\n\nThe crimson fire that reflected in the glass window on the ground floor of the house was akin to sunlight that could dispel darkness.\n\nLumian sprinted all the way to his two-story building, yanked open the unlatched door, and rushed inside.\n\nAfter locking the door, he gazed at the ruins through the window.\n\nFar from the gray mist, at the edge of the ruins, there stood a faint figure, but it didn't approach.\n\nPhew. Lumian exhaled and planned to extinguish the fire, ascend upstairs to slumber, and exit the dream.\n\nHe glanced at the still-burning fire and murmured to himself, It can still burn for a while\u2026 I can experiment and see if it continues to burn until it extinguishes after I depart the dream, or if it is frozen in time the moment I leave\u2026\n\nLumian had previously verified through the rain that the wilderness where the ruins were located was undergoing natural development. It had nothing to do with whether he was dreaming or not, but whether the same situation was transpiring in his house or the so-called safe zone remained to be verified.\n\nHe acted on his notion. He added a few more coals to the fire and fiddled with them. Then, he carried the axe and steel fork to the second floor and entered the bedroom.\n\n...\n\nWhen Lumian arose, it was just after daybreak.\n\nHe inspected his shirt-like pajamas. As anticipated, he was disheartened to discover that the gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins did not accompany him into reality.\n\nLumian exited the bed and stretched his body. He sauntered to the desk and extended his hand to draw the curtains.\n\nAmidst the sound, a mild and refreshing radiance trickled in.\n\nAs the window opened, fresh and organic air invaded Lumian's nostrils. He couldn't help but extend himself, feeling that waking up early was quite pleasant at times.\n\nOf course, this was also owing to the \"Patriotic Public Health Campaign\" that Emperor Roselle had launched. It was also thanks to the subsequent rulers who had preserved it and only altered its name.\n\nHe surveyed his surroundings, sometimes gazing at the far-off forest, sometimes scrutinizing the orange-red clouds in the sky, and sometimes observing the weeds outside the house.\n\nSuddenly, Lumian's stare froze.\n\nHe spied a larger bird perched on an elm tree not far away.\n\nIt had a pointed beak, a feline face, brown feathers with scattered spots, brownish-yellow eyes combined with black pupils, giving it a sharp appearance.\n\nIt was an owl.\n\nIt appeared to be observing Lumian.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 12": "It was the dead of night, and all was quiet.\n\nLumian stirred in his dream once more. The first thing he glimpsed was a faint gray mist.\n\nOn impulse, he reached into his shirt pocket with his hand.\n\nThe frigid sensation of cold, hard metal immediately registered in his mind.\n\nHe retrieved the object he'd felt. A glint of gold illuminated his eyes.\n\nIt was a gold coin.\n\nA Louis d'or.\n\nIt's still here\u2026 Lumian sat up and peered down at himself.\n\nHe still donned the cotton attire, pants, and leather jacket from his last expedition. The nearly two-meter-long steel pitchfork and sharp, iron-black axe rested within arm's reach.\n\nThis was precisely the same condition as when he'd exited the dream.\n\nIn other words, this dream is persistent. It doesn't reset with each entry\u2026 Lumian fiddled with the Louis d'or and slipped it into his cotton shirt's inner pocket.\n\nThough it couldn't be actualized, it was still a joy to have.\n\nLumian rose from bed and gazed out the window for a spell, ensuring the red mountain peak in the ruins hadn't changed.\n\nHe hoisted his axe and pitchfork, departed his chamber, and entered the dimly lit corridor.\n\nAurore's bedroom and study doors remained ajar.\n\nLumian studied them briefly, then suddenly conceived an idea.\n\nIn the dream, my room is practically identical to reality. It contains all the expected elements. Aurore's room appears the same at first glance.\n\nHowever, can I locate her witchcraft notebook, secret potion formula, or learn how to become a Warlock in her quarters?\n\nThis notion was akin to a devil's whisper, causing Lumian's heart to race. He was tempted to try.\n\nCompared to exploring the unknown, hazardous, enigmatic ruins, sifting through Aurore's room was the simpler, safer option.\n\nNo, no! Lumian shook his head vigorously and cast the idea aside.\n\nHe'd rather take his chances than violate Aurore's privacy. He wouldn't venture into her bedroom without her approval.\n\nThis was due to his respect for Aurore.\n\nIf it weren't for Aurore, he would have perished as a child on the streets five years ago.\n\nLumian withdrew his pained gaze and made his way to the stairs.\n\nIf the occupant of the room wasn't Aurore, he would have already delved in to search for useful information.\n\nOnce downstairs, Lumian didn't hasten his departure. Instead, he inspected the provisions in the kitchen.\n\nThe olive oil, corn oil, and animal fat that Aurore had amassed were neatly arranged in buckets and cans, just like in reality.\n\nAlmost instinctively, Lumian lifted the bucket of corn oil and positioned it near the stove.\n\nHis sole reason for selecting it was that animal fat and olive oil were pricier.\n\nThen he adeptly kindled a blaze in the hearth with coal and wood, and fashioned a couple of torches to ignite.\n\nHe was preparing to incinerate that monster.\n\nNaturally, it would be preferable if there were other options. That was a last resort.\n\nAfter completing these tasks, he retrieved his axe, opened the door, and departed.\n\nLumian then observed something unusual.\n\nThe faint gray mist that suffused the dream felt more humid than before. The ground beneath his feet was also slightly muddy.\n\nIt rained? This place persists and develops naturally according to certain laws when I'm absent or dreaming? Lumian was somewhat taken aback, but he had an inkling that it was only fitting.\n\nRecalling Aurore's bizarre tales, he suddenly had a notion.\n\nThis can't be the real world, can it?\n\nMy dream is connected to the genuine world. That tarot card enables me to traverse the barrier between dream and the ruins while conscious?\n\nLumian swiftly surveyed his surroundings and realized that an endless gray fog bordered both sides of the ruins, on the dream's periphery.\n\nI'll check later. I won't venture into the ruins. I'll stroll out of the gray fog and see if it's a surreal and irrational dream after passing through the gray fog, or if there's tangible land, sky, village, and town\u2026\n\nIf it were the former, it signified that this place was still a dream. If it wasn't, Lumian had to confirm which world this was.\n\nHe surmised that based on the usage of the Louis d'or, this place still appeared to be in the Intis Republic, but it might not be the present era. It could be a location that had vanished decades or centuries ago.\n\nHowever, Lumian sensed that there was a high likelihood that he wouldn't be able to exit the encompassing gray fog.\n\nHe gathered his thoughts and proceeded toward the ruins.\n\nHe didn't forget that the purpose of entering the dream was to attempt to contend with that monster.\n\nAfter traversing a hundred to two hundred meters in the muddy wilderness riddled with gravel and crevices, Lumian abruptly halted.\n\nHe thought of a problem.\n\nHe'd overlooked something in his preparations earlier!\n\nPreviously, his two-story abode lacked any flames. It was quite secure in this world cloaked in gray fog. But now, it had a blazing furnace that emitted light. Would it draw in a swarm of monsters and render the safe zone unsafe?\n\nLumian instinctively turned his head and peered in the direction he'd come from. He observed that a scarlet gleam had been etched on various glass windows at the base of the half-submerged two-story structure in the faint gray mist.\n\nIt was akin to a beacon in the dark world.\n\nConsidering that a considerable amount of time had elapsed, it was evidently too late to attempt to extinguish the fire. Lumian hastened his pace and entered the ruins, taking refuge in the building that had crumbled due to a conflagration.\n\nHe clipped the axe to the back of his belt and agilely scaled a wall, concealing himself in a shadowy nook separated by bricks and timber.\n\nLumian gazed at his home on the other side of the wilderness.\n\nAs time ticked by, he didn't witness any monsters lured by the fire.\n\nSeems like the fire won't trigger any changes. At the very least, my house won't be besieged by monsters\u2026 Lumian breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThis meant that even if he encountered any peril, as long as he could flee home promptly and slumber as soon as possible, he could successfully elude it.\n\nHe began to contemplate how to entice and eliminate the previous monster.\n\nFrom their brief skirmish, he'd deduced that its strength, speed, reaction time, and agility were similar to his, but he could sense that it fought on instinct. It lacked sufficient experience, expertise, or corresponding intelligence. That's why he'd been able to counter and slay it when it ambushed him\u2026\n\nIt'll also be bewildered and taken aback. It's not dissimilar to humans\u2026\n\nOther than combat techniques, I have two other advantages over it. Firstly, I possess superior intelligence. Secondly, I know how to wield weapons and utilize tools. This is the greatest advantage humans possess over such monsters\u2026\n\nAs long as I'm cautious, defeating it again won't be arduous. The most crucial aspect is how to eradicate it completely\u2026\n\nJust as Lumian was about to deliberately stir up some commotion to see if he could lure over some monster, he spied a figure stealthily approaching the utterly ruined house on the side.\n\nThe figure was crimson and devoid of skin. Its muscles, blood vessels, and fascia were exposed. It was the monster from last time.\n\nUnlike before, this monster was wielding a manure fork.\n\nA manure fork!\n\nIt knows how to wield weapons too... Lumian's countenance stiffened as his expression turned grim.\n\nUnwittingly, his confidence waned a bit.\n\nAs the monster drew closer and turned, Lumian perceived exaggerated wounds on its back, neck, and the nape of its neck. However, the fissures were no longer oozing pus, and it appeared to have mostly mended.\n\nIt's indeed the one I encountered previously\u2026\n\nIts self-healing ability is many times superior to that of ordinary humans\u2026\n\nLumian gasped soundlessly.\n\nHe compelled himself to compose and expeditiously assessed the situation.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye, Lumian arrived at a determination.\n\nThis was a prime opportunity, and he had to seize it when he encountered it. He couldn't let it slip by!\n\nHe silently retrieved a stone brick beside him and awaited the monster's arrival at the desired location.\n\nIn just a few strides, the monster entered Lumian's kill zone.\n\nLumian abruptly hurled the stone brick at the ground behind the monster.\n\nThud!\n\nThe stone brick clattered, causing the monster to swivel around and scrutinize the assailant.\n\nUpon beholding this, Lumian seized the axe with both hands and pounced fiercely from the wall towards the monster.\n\nBang!\n\nThe axe descended heavily onto the monster's neck, cleaving it in two.\n\nWith twin thuds, Lumian and the monster plummeted to the ground simultaneously.\n\nLumian sprang up nimbly, seized his axe, and darted over, delivering weighty slashes to the monster's neck.\n\nOnce, twice, thrice. The monster didn't even get a chance to resist before its head was lopped off.\n\nAs the head rolled aside, the skinless body convulsed twice and ceased movement.\n\nLumian didn't halt there. He took a diagonal step, rotated his axe, and pulverized the vicious head with its thick back, reducing it to fragments.\n\nSubsequently, he pivoted and hacked at the exposed muscles, blood vessels, and fascia, crushing the heart and other vital organs.\n\nAfter accomplishing all of this, Lumian took two paces backward and surveyed his handiwork. He panted and chuckled softly.\n\n\"I thought you were truly invincible. Who'd have thought you possessed so little ability!\"\n\nAmidst the subdued laughter, the decapitated cadaver abruptly jolted upward.\n\nLumian's pupils contracted, and he instinctively wished to pivot and flee.\n\nHe forcefully quelled this impulse and strode forward once more, brandishing his axe.\n\nAfter the corpse bounced twice, it reverted to immobility, as if it had writhed in vain.\n\nLumian scrutinized it a while longer and ultimately verified that the monster was wholly deceased.\n\nHow tenacious... Lumian sighed inwardly. Then, he leaned over and crouched down. He employed his axe to pry open the muscles and fascias and scrutinized the corpse.\n\nThe monster's bodily structure wasn't dissimilar to a human's, but its muscles were evidently more animated. Even though it was already dead, some of its incisions were still wriggling slightly.\n\nThere's no treasure, nor is there any supernatural power transferred into my body\u2026 Lumian assessed his present state and felt somewhat disenchanted.\n\nThe adage that one grows stronger with each monster they slay indeed only existed in Aurore's tales.\n\nHe then relocated the monster's corpse and head into the ruined building and entombed them with bricks and timber.\n\nSubsequently, he scoured the burnt-down house, hoping to discover something.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 13": "After a bout of searching, Lumian stumbled upon a considerable number of gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins. In total, there were 197 verl d'or and 25 coppet.\n\nAmong them, Louis d'or alone constituted five.\n\nAs for the paper bills, he only discovered some suspected remnants.\n\nAside from money, Lumian also discovered a small blue book.\n\nThe book had a grayish-blue cover and measured approximately 21 by 28.5 centimeters, a typical size found in Intis villages and towns.\n\nIt was based on the calendar and blended with the religious teachings of the two major Churches. It had a rather positive effect on guiding farmers and herders to farm, produce, and graze to enrich their spiritual lives.\n\nNaturally, even though it had been nearly two centuries since Emperor Roselle advocated compulsory education, there were still a large number of farmers, herdsmen, and workers who knew no more than a handful of words and were illiterate. They could only rely on the explanations of certain people around them to obtain the instructions they needed from the blue book, literally known as livre bleu.\n\nLumian flipped through a few pages nonchalantly and realized that the livre bleu was no different from his own. It was just that it appeared a little older overall.\n\nThere's the livre bleu and so much verl d'or; this family is undoubtedly well-to-do in the countryside. There aren't more than five such families in Cordu\u2026 Lumian discarded the livre bleu and placed the gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins into different pockets. Some were stashed deep in the cotton shirt's pocket, some were tucked into his pants pocket, and some were haphazardly stuffed into the pocket of his leather jacket.\n\nEven though Lumian knew that this wealth couldn't be brought to reality, he couldn't resist collecting it for safekeeping.\n\nThese little trinkets of gold, silver, or copper were simply irresistible.\n\nDuring his days as a vagrant, he cherished every coin he came across, even if it was just a coppet or a lick. He often fought with others for them and took risks to obtain them.\n\nAfter scouting the area, Lumian hoisted his axe and crept towards the collapsed building closer to the reddish-brown mountain peak.\n\nHe proceeded deeper and deeper. Every time he traversed the empty space in the center of the ring, he was apprehensive that dozens of monsters would suddenly ambush him in an area without cover.\n\nIn the faint gray fog, Lumian crouched down and sneaked behind a half-collapsed stone wall. He squatted there and utilized it to conceal his form.\n\nHe cautiously poked his head out and surveyed the area ahead.\n\nIt was a narrow strip between two rows of destroyed buildings. There were no trees, no weeds, just gravel, crevices, and dirt.\n\nSuddenly, a figure jumped into Lumian's line of sight.\n\nIt stood in the opposing building, staring at something.\n\nThis figure was garbed in a black robe with a hood. From the back, there was nothing peculiar. It appeared to be an ordinary human.\n\nLumian's heart constricted as he became even more watchful.\n\nIn such a dream ruin, the appearance of a regular person was far more terrifying than the appearance of a monster!\n\nAs if sensing that someone was observing him, the figure swiveled around slowly.\n\nLumian snuck a quick glance before retracting his head hastily. He leaned against the wall and didn't dare to budge.\n\nWith just one look, he had the impression that he had descended into hell or an abyss.\n\nThe figure was indeed a human, but 'he' had three faces and six eyes!\n\nThe face in front had cloudy eyes, sparse eyebrows, and numerous wrinkles. He was evidently an old man.\n\nThe left side was a chiseled face with sharp-looking blue eyes and a thick, black beard, making him appear like a burly man.\n\nThe skin on the right side was smooth and delicate, like a peeled egg. The blue eyes exuded obvious innocence and ignorance. It didn't seem a day over five years of age.\n\nWhat kind of monster is this\u2026 Lumian attempted to regulate his breathing to prevent his heart from racing.\n\nSuch a monster had never surfaced, even in Aurore's horror tales. Only in the deepest and most absurd nightmares could it be encountered.\n\nAlthough it was not good to judge a 'person' by their appearance, Lumian instinctively sensed that the three-faced monster was far more powerful than the skinless monster from earlier!\n\nFurthermore, there was a high probability that it had exceptional abilities.\n\nEternal Blazing Sun. Great Father, please protect me from being discovered by it\u2026 Upon witnessing this scene, Lumian couldn't help but pray to the Eternal Blazing Sun.\n\nIf he weren't still clutching an axe in one hand and was in a perilous environment, he would have extended his arms, a gesture symbolizing the adoration of the sun.\n\nAt that moment, time appeared to stand still. Lumian believed he might be hallucinating.\n\nIt was as if someone's stare pierced through the wall and landed on his back.\n\nHis back stiffened instantly and felt somewhat warm.\n\nIn just a second or two, the illusion vanished, and heavy footsteps receded into the distance.\n\nLumian waited a while until the footsteps dissipated completely. Then, he gradually straightened his knees, turned around, and poked his head out to survey the area ahead.\n\nThe monster was farther away, having arrived behind the collapsed building whose two sides still stood. Half of its body was visible in the faint gray mist.\n\nIt still had his back to Lumian, as though it had transformed into a statue.\n\nLumian breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nHe didn't have the confidence to confront such a monster.\n\nIt's definitely impossible to venture deeper into the ruins from here\u2026 Should I circumvent it?\n\nWon't there be comparable monsters elsewhere?\n\nThe closer I approach that mountain peak, the more potent the monsters that emerge?\n\nLumian retracted his body and deliberated for a while before deciding to conclude the night.\n\nHe intended to inquire with the woman who gave him the tarot card after daybreak to see if there was a means of dealing with the three-faced monster. If there was no alternative, he would consider taking a detour.\n\nHe arched his back, detached from the wall, and headed in the direction he came from.\n\nAt that moment, he had a notion.\n\nIf I slumber in these ruins, will I be able to escape the dream?\n\nConsidering the possibility of numerous monsters in the vicinity, he suppressed the urge to experiment, for now.\n\nOn the way back, he hastily searched every destroyed building he passed, but he couldn't unearth any useful written information. There were only a few coins.\n\nAfter retreating for a while, Lumian conceived a notion and decided to take a detour. He approached the burnt-out house that he encountered first from the side, where he had buried the skinless monster.\n\nHe wanted to see if the monster's demise would be detected by its kin and if it would result in any changes.\n\nAfter locating the spot and concealing himself, Lumian poked his head out from the side and scrutinized the target area.\n\nIn the following moment, he caught sight of another \"figure.\"\n\nThe figure was half-human and half-beast. Its legs were bent forward as it squatted there and inspected the skinless monster's cadaver.\n\nIt had already removed the stone bricks and wooden blocks that Lumian had stacked.\n\nIt wore a dark jacket and relatively snug muddy pants. Its black hair that hung to its neck was unkempt and greasy, and it carried a shotgun on its back.\n\nA shotgun!\n\nLumian averted his gaze hastily and withdrew his head.\n\nThese monsters are truly absurd!\n\nThey actually know how to wield a shotgun\u2026\n\nAt that moment, Lumian felt like he was a hunter, hunting in the mountains with his weapon and comrades, only to discover that the rabbit opposite him was clutching a water-cooled machine gun and targeting them. He considered it ridiculous and immersion-breaking, as well as disappointing.\n\nAs time elapsed, he waited patiently for the monster with the shotgun to depart.\n\nFinally, he discerned a faint sound of movement, gradually receding.\n\nLumian stuck his head out cautiously once again and examined the monster that was half-human and half-beast.\n\n\"It\" moved like a cat towards the back of the building.\n\nInitially, Lumian's heart eased, but then his eyes widened.\n\nHe realized that the path the monster took was precisely the same as the route he took when he ventured deep into the ruins!\n\nIt's tracking me!\n\nIt has an extraordinary tracking ability!\n\nLumian made a subconscious evaluation.\n\nHe was exceedingly grateful that he had opted for a detour when he returned. Otherwise, he would have certainly collided with it and might have even been ambushed!\n\nAs soon as the monster vanished, Lumian sprang up and dashed towards his house.\n\nThe crimson fire that reflected in the glass window on the ground floor of the house was akin to sunlight that could dispel darkness.\n\nLumian sprinted all the way to his two-story building, yanked open the unlatched door, and rushed inside.\n\nAfter locking the door, he gazed at the ruins through the window.\n\nFar from the gray mist, at the edge of the ruins, there stood a faint figure, but it didn't approach.\n\nPhew. Lumian exhaled and planned to extinguish the fire, ascend upstairs to slumber, and exit the dream.\n\nHe glanced at the still-burning fire and murmured to himself, It can still burn for a while\u2026 I can experiment and see if it continues to burn until it extinguishes after I depart the dream, or if it is frozen in time the moment I leave\u2026\n\nLumian had previously verified through the rain that the wilderness where the ruins were located was undergoing natural development. It had nothing to do with whether he was dreaming or not, but whether the same situation was transpiring in his house or the so-called safe zone remained to be verified.\n\nHe acted on his notion. He added a few more coals to the fire and fiddled with them. Then, he carried the axe and steel fork to the second floor and entered the bedroom.\n\n...\n\nWhen Lumian arose, it was just after daybreak.\n\nHe inspected his shirt-like pajamas. As anticipated, he was disheartened to discover that the gold coins, silver coins, and copper coins did not accompany him into reality.\n\nLumian exited the bed and stretched his body. He sauntered to the desk and extended his hand to draw the curtains.\n\nAmidst the sound, a mild and refreshing radiance trickled in.\n\nAs the window opened, fresh and organic air invaded Lumian's nostrils. He couldn't help but extend himself, feeling that waking up early was quite pleasant at times.\n\nOf course, this was also owing to the \"Patriotic Public Health Campaign\" that Emperor Roselle had launched. It was also thanks to the subsequent rulers who had preserved it and only altered its name.\n\nHe surveyed his surroundings, sometimes gazing at the far-off forest, sometimes scrutinizing the orange-red clouds in the sky, and sometimes observing the weeds outside the house.\n\nSuddenly, Lumian's stare froze.\n\nHe spied a larger bird perched on an elm tree not far away.\n\nIt had a pointed beak, a feline face, brown feathers with scattered spots, brownish-yellow eyes combined with black pupils, giving it a sharp appearance.\n\nIt was an owl.\n\nIt appeared to be observing Lumian.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 15": "Lumian was on edge, his mind racing with excitement and fear. \"What is it exactly?\"\n\nThe woman took a leisurely sip of Venus Sacred Oil before replying in a calm, unhurried tone. \n\n\"You have to ask yourself that.\"\n\nHaving said that, she lowered her head slightly and focused on enjoying her breakfast, giving the impression that she had no intention of continuing the conversation.\n\nWhy do you keep parts of the matter untold and only answer at the next opportunity? Isn't this a waste of everyone's time? He couldn't help but feel inferior to her ability to infuriate others.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he forced a smile and bade farewell.\n\nLumian obediently spent the rest of the day at home. \n\nThis wasn't out of fear of the owl to the point of not daring to step out during the day, nor was it because he had nothing to do, but to avoid arousing suspicion.\n\nLumian was determined to get to the bottom of the help-seeking letter that Leah and her companions had in their possession. He needed to find out what was written and who wrote it. The key to his investigation was to flip through every livre bleu in the village and find the one with words cut out. As a villager, Lumian was best suited for this task, but he was hesitant to proceed after talking to the three foreigners. It could attract someone's attention and cause unnecessary trouble.\n\nThis was a matter of life and death, survival or doom, and Lumian knew that even with Aurore's protection, he couldn't guarantee that the other party wouldn't take any risky actions against him.\n\nIn the past two years, he had become better at figuring out the threshold required for pranks. \n\nThis was due to his rich experience.\n\nHe planned on \"visiting\" every family in a few days, using the excuse of pursuing the legends related to Lent.\n\nAfter dinner, when it was dark, Aurore returned to her bedroom to finally write a manuscript that was long overdue.\n\nLumian entered the study planning to find some books related to dreams to read, hoping to gain some special inspiration for his dream.\n\nAs they only had one battery-powered table lamp at home, which was being used by Aurore, he had to light up the kerosene lamp that had a pungent smell and was not great for illumination purposes.\n\nCarrying the kerosene lamp that emitted a dim yellow glow, Lumian quickly swiped his other hand across the backs of the books. Occasionally, he would choose a book and clamp it under his armpit.\n\nAfter a while, he returned to the table with three selected books.\n\nJust as he placed the books in his hand, Lumian saw the livre bleu at home.\n\nIt was quietly placed in a corner of the desk as usual, and the gray-blue cover seemed a little dusty.\n\nUpon seeing this livre bleu, Lumian instantly thought of the book he had obtained in the dream ruins and the book that had been cut and meshed into a plea for help.\n\nHe reached out and picked up the livre bleu in front of him, planning to flip through the content to see which words were suitable for cutting and piecing into useful sentences.\n\nAfter flipping through a few pages, Lumian's gaze froze.\n\nThere was an obvious hole in the notes attached to the current calendar page.\n\nA word had been cut out!\n\n\"No way\u2026\" Lumian whispered, extremely shocked.\n\nHe quickly flipped through the livre bleu in his hand and found more than ten words cut out.\n\n\"No way\u2026\" Lumian whispered again, his reaction almost the same as before.\n\nThe livre bleu that Ryan, Leah, Valentine, and the others were searching for turned out to be the one at home!\n\nNot only had they not expected it, but Lumian had never even fathomed this possibility!\n\nIt didn't even cross his mind!\n\nAmidst the indescribably complicated emotions, Lumian frowned.\n\nCould it be Aurore who requested help?\n\nWhy did she seek help from the officials? Why didn't she tell me?\n\nBased on Leah and the others' behavior, their habitual choice to discuss matters with the padre as soon as they arrived, and other details, Lumian made a preliminary judgment that they were officials. They could be from the government, Dari\u00e8ge's Eternal Blazing Sun Church, or the God of Steam and Machinery Church.\n\nLumian hesitated, his expression constantly changing.\n\nFinally, he made up his mind. He took the livre bleu and walked out of the study to Aurore's bedroom.\n\nHe planned on asking her directly and chose to believe in Aurore.\n\nKnock! Knock! Knock! Lumian bent his finger and knocked on the door.\n\n\"Come on in.\" Aurore's voice sounded.\n\nLumian turned the handle and pushed open the door to enter. Under the bright light of the table lamp, Aurore, who was wearing a two-piece cotton pajama set, had bound her golden hair with a headband and was engrossed in writing a story.\n\n\"Did you cut this?\" Lumian asked, interrupting his sister before she could speak.\n\n\"Huh?\" Aurore turned around in confusion, her eyes blank and distant, as if she was still deep in thought.\n\nLumian handed over the livre bleu, which had been flipped to the corresponding page, and stared into Aurore's eyes.\n\n\"You didn't cut this?\"\n\nAurore gazed at it carefully for a few seconds before looking up in amusement.\n\n\"Would I be so bored and childish? I'm steady, mature, and broadminded, unlike you.\"\n\nAurore's reaction was natural, and she didn't seem surprised or flustered that her secret had been exposed. Lumian didn't hide his confusion and asked, \"But who would have cut out words from the livre bleu?\"\n\n\"Wasn't it you?\" Aurore sized up her brother. \"After reading my novel, you planned on mimicking what you read and cut out words from books and newspapers to create a random letter to play a huge prank on the village. But before that, you wanted to see if you could fool me? Are you testing my deductive abilities?\"\n\nThis really doesn't seem like Aurore's doing\u2026 Lumian's gaze was fixed on Aurore's face, not letting go of even the slightest change in her expression, but his sister's performance was flawless.\n\n\"It wasn't me.\" Lumian frowned. \"Who could have done it?\"\n\nAurore smiled. \"Go on and play your little game of deduction. I have a manuscript to finish. If I have time tomorrow, I'll help you figure out the truth.\"\n\nUsing extraordinary means? Lumian tersely acknowledged her words and stopped disturbing his sister's creation.\n\nHe took the livre bleu and returned to his unlit room, sitting on the chair behind the desk.\n\n\"Who could it be?\" Under the illumination of the crimson moon, Lumian muttered, trying to make deductions.\n\nWe are a family of two. Aurore is a Warlock with extraordinary abilities. She won't let others ransack our home\u2026 \n\nIf it's really not her, and in her words, 'when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.'\n\nSo, in the case of having only two choices, I'm actually the one who did this?\n\nFor a moment, Lumian found it absurd and funny.\n\nSo I'm the 'criminal'?\n\nWhy don't I know that?\n\nLumian couldn't help but turn his body and look at the full-body mirror attached to the wardrobe.\n\nUnder the crimson moonlight, his mirror reflection was wearing a linen shirt and brown pants. His handsome features didn't have a smile on them, and his expression was abnormally heavy.\n\nHe was very sure that he had never cut out the content from the livre bleu.\n\nTo eliminate the possibility, he recalled his experiences in the past month. \n\nAlthough many details were already a blur, he was still very certain about what he had done.\n\nBathing in the crimson moon's light that seeped in through the windows, Lumian muttered to himself, \"Could it be that I did it when I was unconscious? While having that dream, I can sleepwalk in reality? No, that's impossible. Aurore said that she would watch me. If I really sleepwalked and cut the livre bleu, she would have pointed it out just now. Moreover, the letter must have been sent during the day. I'm very awake during those times.\"\n\nLumian eliminated himself and thought of other possibilities.\n\nSomeone else who came here, perhaps?\n\nAlthough their family had few guests usually, it did not mean that they did not have any.\n\nFirstly, poorer neighbors would come to borrow the stove or oven to smoke meat or make bread.\n\nSecondly, Lumian's friends would come to his house from time to time to find some simple novels to read or listen to his stories.\n\nLastly, Naz\u00e9lie, Madame Pualis, and a few other ladies visited Aurore from time to time to have a chat with her. Among them, Madame Pualis came the most. She even lent Aurore a pony so that Aurore could ride freely in the mountains. They were quite close.\n\nAfter all, in a village like Cordu, only an author like Aurore was worthy of Madame Pualis' friendship.\n\nMadame Pualis appeared very amiable on the surface, often basking in the sun with the other women and chatting with them, and even catching lice with them. She had a good reputation in the village.\n\nAlthough Madame Pualis and Aurore could be considered friends, Lumian did not like her at all. Madame Pualis would often introduce one of her relatives to Aurore and persuade her to get married and have children as soon as possible.\n\nIt would be fine if Madame Pualis' relatives were nice, but every time Lumian asked around in Dari\u00e8ge, he found that the other party either had bad character or was not very capable. They were about to fall into poverty, and none of them made the cut.\n\nThe first time might have been a coincidence, but with it happening every time, Lumian bore a hatred for Madame Pualis.\n\nIt's definitely impossible for those who come here to smoke meat or bake bread. There's always someone watching them. They won't be allowed to go up to the second floor\u2026 Reimund, Ava, and the others are also unlikely suspects. I'll accompany them the entire time. Madame Pualis, Naz\u00e9lie, and the other ladies have a certain chance. Every time they come, Aurore will keep them in the study to read while she prepares some snacks\u2026\n\nIf Madame Pualis is really a Witch, then it's understandable that she needs to hide her identity from the authorities. Also, she is very careful to use other people's livre bleu to avoid being traced back to her\u2026 \n\nDid she discover something when she was having an affair with the padre? Did she have to protect herself in this way?\n\nThe more he thought about it, the more excited he became. He felt like he was about to lock onto a suspect.\n\nHe stood up, paced a few steps, and suddenly walked downstairs.\n\nHe didn't want to question Madame Pualis, nor did he plan to pry into her actions now. Instead, he planned to find Reimund or Guillaume-junior and use their livre bleu as a comparison to determine which words had been cut out and what sentence could be formed.\n\nThis way, Lumian could recreate the exact content of the request for help.\n\nHe rushed down the stairs, through the kitchen, and opened the front door.\n\nThe crimson darkness outside rushed in, instantly calming him down.\n\n\"Uh, Grande Soeur said that before we figure out the owl's situation, I shouldn't go out after dark\u2026\" Lumian muttered. He took two steps back and closed the door.\n\nAnyway, there was no hurry to borrow the livre bleu. It would be more natural to do it tomorrow.\n\nAfter doing a stretch, Lumian walked towards the staircase.\n\nDing ding ding ding ding.\n\nThe doorbell rang, the sound echoing through the house.\n\n\"Who is it?\" Lumian turned around in confusion, calling out as he walked towards the door.\n\nA slightly magnetic and gentle female voice sounded from outside.\n\n\"It's me, Pualis de Roquefort.\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 18": "That owl?\n\nThat owl from the Warlock legend?\n\nHis mind raced with possibilities, trying to comprehend the gravity of the situation. His blood seemed to freeze.\n\nIt was worse than facing the three-faced monster.\n\nAfter all, this was no longer a dream. This was reality.\n\nEven if his demise in a dream led to the same in reality, it was different psychologically.\n\nWhat should I do?\n\nWill Aurore be implicated?\n\n\u2026\n\nAs Lumian racked his brain for a countermeasure, the owl remained still, observing him with a piercing gaze.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the owl spread its wings and flew towards the distant forest.\n\nIts graceful glide carried it down, down, until it vanished into Cordu.\n\nOnly when the owl had completely vanished did Lumian's mind snap back to the present. \n\nHe slumped into a chair and lifted a hand to his forehead. \n\nHe was drenched in sweat.\n\nIs it truly the owl of the Warlock legend?\n\nHas it truly lived for so many years?\n\nIn any case, it was unlike any other owl with dull eyes. It almost looked human\u2026\n\nIf it's really that owl, why did it choose to fly just outside my window? Is it because I want to uncover the truth about the Warlock legend? But we've already given up\u2026\n\nIt left after a few moments of observation\u2026\n\nI wonder if it will return and cause trouble for Aurore\u2026\n\nDespite wanting to observe the situation further since nothing had happened yet, Lumian knew he couldn't keep it from his sister any longer.\n\nAfter leaving the room, he saw that Aurore was still asleep. He went downstairs to prepare breakfast, all of which were his sister's favorite dishes.\n\nSunny-side up, meringue cookies, ordinary toast with jam\u2026\n\nI have to make noodles later. This time, I'll add meat sauce\u2026 Lumian mentally noted that the noodle compartment was empty and decided to refill it some time in the next two days.\n\nIt was Aurore's favorite dish.\n\nAurore descended the staircase in a flowing nightgown, her golden locks tousled. The breakfast spread was readied.\n\n\"Morning,\" she mumbled, stifling a yawn.\n\nLumian grinned at her. \"It's not getting early.\n\n\"Don't you always say a day's planning starts early in the morning?\" \n\n\"That's right. My plan is to sleep.\" Aurore settled into her seat and tucked into her breakfast with a glass of milk. \n\nLumian sat across from Aurore At the table that could fit six. As he nibbled on a pancake, he casually said, \"I've been in the village for the past few days trying to find out the truth about those legends.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Aurore asked.\n\nLumian was very frank.\n\n\"You didn't want to help me get supernatural powers, so I decided to find my own way. Those legends might contain clues.\"\n\n\"It's almost impossible,\" Aurore commented, her tone casual. \"The legends have been twisted beyond recognition over the years. Or hallucinated by some loony. It's meaningless. Yes, it's also possible that someone specially made up a story as an excuse. Heh heh, and the contributions of rubberneckers like you.\"\n\n\"What?\" Lumian didn't understand what Aurore meant by 'rubbernecker.'\n\nIt wasn't even Intisian.\n\n\"It means people who can't help but get involved in drama they have no business in,\" Aurore explained simply. \"And judging by how you are suddenly raising this matter, I'm guessing you've caused some trouble and now have no choice but to come home to ask your sister for help.\"\n\n\"It can be considered an accident, but it's not to the extent of causing trouble,\" Lumian said, undaunted.\n\nLumian organized his thoughts carefully.\n\n\"My first target was the Warlock legend.\"\n\n\"What Warlock legend?\" Aurore's confusion was palpable.\n\nLumian couldn't believe it. \"You've never heard of it? A long time ago, a person in the village suddenly died. When he was buried, an owl flew over and stopped by his bed. It only flew away when the corpse was lifted. After that, the corpse became very heavy. It took nine bulls to pull the coffin. Only then did the villagers know that the person was a Warlock when he was alive.\"\n\nAurore was listening intently. \n\n\"I really wasn't aware of such a legend before.\"\n\nIt doesn't make sense\u2026 Lumian was incredulous. \n\nAurore may have been a homebody, but she still made time to socialize with the other old ladies in town. She loved telling stories to the children and was always up-to-date on the latest Cordu gossip. It was hard to believe she hadn't heard about the Warlock legend that had been circulating for years.\n\nBut what was even more intriguing was the fact that her house was built on the very spot where the Warlock's home once stood. \n\nLumian had a hunch from the start that Aurore's decision to settle in Cordu was driven by the allure of the Warlock's treasure, the key to unlocking extraordinary power.\n\n\"And then?\" Aurore asked calmly.\n\nLumian answered truthfully, \"We did some digging around, and we got confirmation from the village elders. This wasn't some tall tale. The Warlock really did exist, but that was decades ago. The Church burned the house down, and now the land belongs to you.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Aurore was obviously a little surprised. \"I knew it. There's always a catch. Why else would they sell me this land at a price lower than the norm? I thought it was because of my gift of gab, when it came to old ladies\u2026\"\n\nShe thought for a moment and asked, \"So, the Church burned the Warlock's body?\"\n\nLumian nodded. \"Yes. His ashes are buried in the cemetery beside the cathedral.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We've given up on this matter because all the clues led to a dead end. But this morning, I saw an owl outside my window. It looked just like the one in the legend.\"\n\nAurore's expression became serious. \"Are you certain?\"\n\n\"I can't say for sure, but it didn't look like any ordinary owl,\" Lumian responded objectively.\n\nAurore pondered for a moment before saying slowly, \"Don't leave the village for now. And after dark, don't step outside until I've finished investigating the situation.\"\n\nShe gave a sour smile. \"I've warned you before about the dangers of seeking supernatural power. But look, trouble has already found you.\n\n\"Fortunately, it seems that the other party doesn't have any malicious intentions. The problem should be resolved relatively easily.\"\n\nI'm glad you're on guard\u2026 Lumian lowered his head and said straightforwardly, \"Grande Soeur, I was wrong.\"\n\nHe changed the subject.\n\n\"Did your pen pals write back?\"\n\n\"How can it be that fast? It's not like we're sending e\u2014 Uh, post!\" Aurore scoffed.\n\nLumian was puzzled. Isn't post already referring to letters and packages sent through the post office?\n\nHe was not too concerned. After all, Aurore often used strange words.\n\n...\n\nAt the entrance of Ol' Tavern.\n\nLumian stood there and surveyed the area.\n\nHe knew that the woman who had given him the tarot card wouldn't be awake yet, so he was looking for the three foreigners: Ryan, Leah, and Valentine.\n\nAs expected, the trio was enjoying a lavish breakfast at a table inside the tavern. \n\nLumian observed them for a few seconds, taking in the spread of trout rolls, wine, and mayonnaise bread, before leaving without disturbing them.\n\nSome time later, as Ryan and the others prepared to continue strolling around Cordu and \"chatting\" with the locals, \n\nLumian approached them with open arms and a bright smile.\n\n\"Good morning, my cabbages.\"\n\nValentine's face twitched, and between Ryan and Leah, one looked slightly embarrassed while the other looked amused.\n\nUh, they're dressed exactly the same\u2026 Did they not bring many changes of clothes despite being out? Lumian noticed that Leah was still clad in a snug pleated cashmere dress, a small white coat, and a pair of Marseillan boots, each adorned with a small silver bell. Her veil which doubled as a hat also had bells attached to it. Ryan was still sporting a drab duffel coat and pale yellow strides, topped with a rough dark bowler hat.\n\nAnd Valentine still had powdered hair and makeup on his face.\n\n\"Good morning, Lumian. What brings you here?\" Ryan asked calmly.\n\nLumian looked aggrieved as he responded, \"Well, you guys are my friends, and I have nothing to do. I thought I'd come visit.\"\n\nHe then questioned them, \"I noticed that you've been chatting with people in the village for the past few days. Is there anything you want to ask? \n\n\"You can come to me if you have any questions, my cabbages. I'm your friend.\"\n\n\"We can't trust your answer,\" Valentine interjected.\n\nRyan shot him a look, signaling him to calm down.\n\nLumian smiled.\n\n\"So you can completely trust the others?\"\n\nLeah was at a loss for words, while Ryan thought for a moment before responding, \n\n\"Actually, we can't completely trust anyone. We have to make a comprehensive judgment based on the answers we get from different people and the situation we observe.\"\n\n\"That's more like it.\" Lumian spread his hands. \"Well, then it wouldn't hurt to hear my answer. At least it's a reference.\"\n\nRyan was silent for a moment before glancing around. \n\nThe early morning in Cordu was bustling with people heading to the farmlands, but there was hardly anyone near Ol' Tavern.\n\n\"Here's the deal,\" he said finally. \"We're here to find someone.\"\n\n\"The padre?\" Lumian asked with a smile.\n\nRyan shook his head. \n\n\"No. We visited the padre to find this person.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Lumian asked with interest. \"I know everyone in the village. I should be able to help.\"\n\nRyan did not show any joy.\n\n\"Actually, we don't know who this person is, how old they are, or what they look like.\n\n\"We received an unsigned letter some time ago, and we're trying to find the person who wrote it.\"\n\nLumian couldn't help but wonder if the letter was from an informer. \n\nHe feigned puzzlement.\n\n\"Did the person who wrote the letter not reach out to you after you arrived in the village?\"\n\n\"No,\" Leah replied for Ryan.\n\n\"Perhaps they don't feel safe and don't trust you?\" Lumian suggested eagerly. \"Can't you glean any clues from the contents of the letter?\"\n\nLumian was curious about the letter's contents. \n\nIf it was targeting the padre's crew, he'd be happy to help them. But if it involved Aurore, he'd urge his sister to move. After all, Aurore communicated with her pen pals frequently, and if any of them were caught, she could be implicated. The letter could be a crucial clue.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 16": "Ryan shook his head. \n\n\"The letter was just two simple sentences. It seemed like a man in deep trouble was seeking our help.\"\n\n\"Did he not mention what kind of trouble he was in?\" Lumian breathed a sigh of relief. \n\nThere was no way a letter from Aurore or her pen pals could be that short.\n\n\"Nothing,\" Ryan replied with a soft sigh.\n\nLumian couldn't help but mock them in his heart. It's just a letter asking for help, and you're here? Aren't you afraid this is just a prank? Even the people from the Inquisition aren't as enthusiastic as you. Isn't this too nice, too kind, and too missionful?\n\nNormally, he would have voiced these thoughts aloud, but he needed to get information from them, so he held his tongue and forced himself to be patient.\n\nDespite his reservations, Lumian knew that Ryan wouldn't reveal the entire situation to him. They must have other considerations or reasons for coming to Cordu and searching for the person who wrote the vague letter.\n\n\"Uh\u2026\" Lumian stroked his chin and suggested tentatively, \"Why don't you show me the letter? Perhaps I can identify the writer from their handwriting.\"\n\nValentine, with his powdered hair, gave Lumian a look that said: \"Do you think we're fools?\"\n\nLeah chuckled.\n\n\"Do you know how to appraise handwriting?\"\n\n\"Barely,\" Lumian admitted sincerely.\n\nHe then added inwardly, Being able to appraise Aurore's and my own handwriting is also considered a form of appraisal.\n\n\"It's useless,\" Ryan interjected, shaking his head. \"Every word in the letter came from a livre bleu, and the entire sentence was comprised of cut slips.\"\n\nLumian couldn't help but wonder why the writer was being so cautious. Why hide their identity in such a way when they were asking for help? Were they afraid of interception and retaliation, or was there something wrong with them that they didn't want to be exposed? Lumian tried to analyze the writer's mentality.\n\nLumian put on a look of realization and said, \"So you've been chatting with people in the village to see if anyone else has experienced similar damage to their livre bleu?\n\n\"But the person who wrote the letter could have purchased a new livre bleu without anyone knowing, or even thrown it away after using it.\"\n\n\"That's just one of the leads we're following,\" Ryan explained calmly.\n\nLumian didn't treat himself as an outsider at all and asked, \"Are there any other leads?\"\n\n\"Well, if someone is asking for help, then something must be happening, and there will always be some traces left behind,\" Ryan responded after some thought.\n\n\"That makes sense,\" Lumian said, looking troubled for Ryan and the others, as if he could empathize with their situation.\n\nHe promised solemnly, \"My cabbages, I'll keep an eye out for you. Hopefully, we'll find some clues.\"\n\n\"Thank you,\" Ryan replied politely.\n\nLeah had regained her composure and asked Lumian, \"Since we're friends, I have a question for you.\"\n\n\"Go ahead.\" Lumian smiled.\n\n\"Why did the villagers in the tavern laugh when you called us 'cabbage'?\" Leah was rather intrigued.\n\nAlthough it was embarrassing, 'cabbage' was a common local slang term, and it shouldn't have been a cause for laughter.\n\nLumian explained sincerely, \"In slang, 'cabbage' means darling or beloved. It's mainly used between intimate friends or between an elder and a junior. 'My bunny' and 'my chicks' are similar.\"\n\nHe emphasized the word 'intimate' as he spoke.\n\nThen, with an innocent expression, he added, \"I just wanted us to be intimate friends.\"\n\nLumian's innocent expression suggested that he had no idea what 'intimate' meant.\n\nMore like you want to be our senior\u2026 Leah finally understood why the villagers were laughing.\n\nWhile Lumian's explanation may not have been entirely truthful, it was logically convincing.\n\nRyan nodded in agreement. \n\n\"Is there anything else?\"\n\n\"Nope,\" Lumian replied, not wanting to appear too eager and arouse suspicion about him and Aurore. \n\nHis sister couldn't undergo an investigation!\n\nAfter watching Leah and the others leave with the sound of the tinkling bells, Lumian sat at the entrance of Ol' Tavern and waited for the lady with the mysterious background to wake up.\n\nAfter a while, Lumian's friend, Reimund Greg, approached him.\n\n\"Lumian, have you decided which legend to investigate next?\" Reimund asked.\n\nIn the past two days, Reimund had been even more proactive than Lumian in this matter. After all, he didn't have any strange dreams or other ways of obtaining treasure.\n\n\"Not yet.\" The owl had already come knocking on his door. He couldn't risk investigating the legend without confirming the situation first.\n\n\"I'll think about it after the Lent festival,\" Lumian explained, trying to sound casual.\n\n\"Okay, that makes sense,\" Reimund agreed. \"I don't have to be a Greenwatcher for the time being then. I'll head out after Lent. Even if there are grazers in the meantime, it won't cause much damage.\"\n\n\"Do you mean you don't have to leave the village for the next few days?\" Lumian asked Reimund.\n\nReimund nodded in confirmation, and Lumian smiled. \n\n\"What a coincidence. I can't leave the village for the next few days either.\"\n\nReimund was confused. \"Why not?\" he asked.\n\nLumian lowered his voice and spoke with a serious expression. \n\n\"This morning, I met the owl from the Warlock legend. It said that if it weren't for the cathedral and the gaze of God in the village, it would have taken my soul and thrown it into the abyss\u2026\"\n\nReimund was shocked and frightened, and his entire body trembled. \n\n\"Is that for real? I told you not to provoke such an evil creature\u2026\"\n\nReimund suddenly saw a smile appear on Lumian's face.\n\n\"\u2026\" Only then did Reimund remember his good friend's nature.\n\n\"You're pulling a prank on me, it's a lie, isn't it?\" he asked, feeling both angry and anxious.\n\nHe was angry at himself for falling for Lumian's deception yet again. He knew what kind of person Lumian was and had been fooled by him many times before.\n\n\"You believe such a ridiculous thing?\" Lumian chuckled.\n\nQuietly, Lumian added to himself that he had made up the story to prevent Reimund from going straight to the cathedral to repent when he couldn't withstand the pressure.\n\nReimund relaxed and breathed a sigh of relief. \"Phew\u2026\"\n\nLumian offered some advice to Reimund. \n\n\"Although I made up that story just now, it's true that pursuing the truth of a legend can be dangerous. Try not to leave the village or the cathedral's protection if you can.\"\n\nSilently, Lumian added to himself, And that's the truth. Although most of the story was fabricated, half of it was true. I wouldn't have reminded you and shared Aurore's advice in a different way if I didn't need your help with many things in the future. Whether someone lives or dies has nothing to do with me\u2026\n\nReimund recalled the feeling of fear and nodded in understanding. \n\n\"Alright!\"\n\nHe changed the subject and asked, \"Who are you going to vote for to be the Spring Elf?\"\n\nThe Spring Elf was the symbol of spring and the start of many celebrations during Lent. In the Dari\u00e8ge area, the whole village usually voted for an unwed, beautiful girl to play the role.\n\n\"Ava,\" Lumian replied nonchalantly. \"Hasn't she always wanted to be the Spring Elf?\"\n\n\"I'll choose her too,\" Reimund said, secretly relieved. \n\nYesterday, Ava had hinted to him that she wanted him to vote for her, so he felt the need to help her canvas for votes.\n\n...\n\nOutside a house not far from Ol' Tavern.\n\nRyan, Leah, and Valentine weren't in a hurry to find someone to \"chat.\"\n\nValentine raised his hand to cover his mouth and nose. \"Is it really okay to say so much to that guy just now?\" he asked. \n\nThe air around them was filled with the faint smell of poultry feces.\n\nLeah fiddled with a silver bell above her head. \"I don't know if there's a problem. All I can confirm is that my divination results tell me he's of help.\"\n\nRyan explained his intention. \"If we can't turn the situation around, leaking some information and instilling fear in the relevant people could be effective. Next, we'll observe him more closely and see what he'll do or who he'll find.\"\n\n...\n\nAfter Reimund left, Lumian entered Ol' Tavern and saw the lady who had given him the tarot card in her usual spot. \n\nShe was wearing a white blouse and a pair of baggy light-colored pants, and beside her hand was a round straw hat adorned with a few yellow flowers.\n\nShe really has a lot of clothes in her suitcase. She changes them every day, unlike Leah and the others who look so shabby, Lumian thought to himself as he moved closer and sat opposite her.\n\nDuring this process, he casually glanced at her breakfast, which consisted of a plump mince pie with a thinned sauce, a few darioles, cubed seasonal fruit, and a light-colored transparent drink with some impurities.\n\nThis isn't something Ol' Tavern can provide\u2026 Lumian pointed at the drink on the table and asked the lady, as though they were close friends, \"What is this? It doesn't look like wine.\"\n\n\"It's called 'Venus Sacred Oil,'\" the lady replied casually. \"It's made from sugar and cinnamon water soaked in vanilla and mixed with poppies. It was invented by a bar in Trier.\"\n\nThe word \"Venus\" came from Emperor Roselle. He mentioned in a story that she was a woman comparable to a Goddess of Beauty.\n\nLumian was intrigued. \"Where did you get it? Did you concoct it yourself?\" he asked, suspecting that the nearest city, Dari\u00e8ge, couldn't provide something similar.\n\nThe lady smiled.\n\n\"As a traveler, it's my professional instinct to obtain suitable things at the right time.\"\n\nLumian was honest. \"I don't understand.\"\n\nHe then said, \"I've finished the previous monster. This time, I've encountered two even more dangerous ones\u2026\n\nHe went on to describe the monster with three faces and the one with a shotgun on its back. \n\n\"I feel that they all have powers that surpass ordinary humans. They're not something I can deal with. Is there any way to deal with them?\"\n\nThe lady took a bite of the dariole and rolled her eyes. She smiled and said, \"I'm not sure about the three-faced monster, but you are more than capable of dealing with the one with the shotgun, as long as you use what's special about yourself.\"\n\nLumian was both surprised and confused. \"A special trait\u2026 What's so special about me?\" \n\nI don't even know myself!\n\nThe lady smiled at him and said, \"That's your dream. As the owner of the dream, you naturally enjoy special treatment. It's just that you haven't realized it yet.\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 17": "That owl?\n\nThat owl from the Warlock legend?\n\nHis mind raced with possibilities, trying to comprehend the gravity of the situation.

A long time ago, a person in the village suddenly died. When he was buried, an owl flew over and stopped by his bed. It only flew away when the corpse was lifted. After that, the corpse became very heavy. It took nine bulls to pull the coffin. Only then did the villagers know that the person was a Warlock when he was alive.\"\n\nAurore was listening intently. \n\n\"I really wasn't aware of such a legend before.\"\n\nIt doesn't make sense\u2026 Lumian was incredulous. \n\nAurore may have been a homebody, but she still made time to socialize with the other old ladies in town. She loved telling stories to the children and was always up-to-date on the latest Cordu gossip. It was hard to believe she hadn't heard about the Warlock legend that had been circulating for years.\n\nBut what was even more intriguing was the fact that her house was built on the very spot where the Warlock's home once stood. \n\nLumian had a hunch from the start that Aurore's decision to settle in Cordu was driven by the allure of the Warlock's treasure, the key to unlocking extraordinary power.\n\n\"And then?\" Aurore asked calmly.\n\nLumian answered truthfully, \"We did some digging around, and we got confirmation from the village elders. This wasn't some tall tale. The Warlock really did exist, but that was decades ago. The Church burned the house down, and now the land belongs to you.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Aurore was obviously a little surprised. \"I knew it. There's always a catch. Why else would they sell me this land at a price lower than the norm? I thought it was because of my gift of gab, when it came to old ladies\u2026\"\n\nShe thought for a moment and asked, \"So, the Church burned the Warlock's body?\"\n\nLumian nodded. \"Yes. His ashes are buried in the cemetery beside the cathedral.\"\n\nHe continued, \"We've given up on this matter because all the clues led to a dead end. But this morning, I saw an owl outside my window. It looked just like the one in the legend.\"\n\nAurore's expression became serious. \"Are you certain?\"\n\n\"I can't say for sure, but it didn't look like any ordinary owl,\" Lumian responded objectively.\n\nAurore pondered for a moment before saying slowly, \"Don't leave the village for now. And after dark, don't step outside until I've finished investigating the situation.\"\n\nShe gave a sour smile. \"I've warned you before about the dangers of seeking supernatural power. But look, trouble has already found you.\n\n\"Fortunately, it seems that the other party doesn't have any malicious intentions. The problem should be resolved relatively easily.\"\n\nI'm glad you're on guard\u2026 Lumian lowered his head and said straightforwardly, \"Grande Soeur, I was wrong.\"\n\nHe changed the subject.\n\n\"Did your pen pals write back?\"\n\n\"How can it be that fast? It's not like we're sending e\u2014 Uh, post!\" Aurore scoffed.\n\nLumian was puzzled. Isn't post already referring to letters and packages sent through the post office?\n\nHe was not too concerned. After all, Aurore often used strange words.\n\n...\n\nAt the entrance of Ol' Tavern.\n\nLumian stood there and surveyed the area.\n\nHe knew that the woman who had given him the tarot card wouldn't be awake yet, so he was looking for the three foreigners: Ryan, Leah, and Valentine.\n\nAs expected, the trio was enjoying a lavish breakfast at a table inside the tavern. \n\nLumian observed them for a few seconds, taking in the spread of trout rolls, wine, and mayonnaise bread, before leaving without disturbing them.\n\nSome time later, as Ryan and the others prepared to continue strolling around Cordu and \"chatting\" with the locals, \n\nLumian approached them with open arms and a bright smile.\n\n\"Good morning, my cabbages.\"\n\nValentine's face twitched, and between Ryan and Leah, one looked slightly embarrassed while the other looked amused.\n\nUh, they're dressed exactly the same\u2026 Did they not bring many changes of clothes despite being out? Lumian noticed that Leah was still clad in a snug pleated cashmere dress, a small white coat, and a pair of Marseillan boots, each adorned with a small silver bell. Her veil which doubled as a hat also had bells attached to it. Ryan was still sporting a drab duffel coat and pale yellow strides, topped with a rough dark bowler hat.\n\nAnd Valentine still had powdered hair and makeup on his face.\n\n\"Good morning, Lumian. What brings you here?\" Ryan asked calmly.\n\nLumian looked aggrieved as he responded, \"Well, you guys are my friends, and I have nothing to do. I thought I'd come visit.\"\n\nHe then questioned them, \"I noticed that you've been chatting with people in the village for the past few days. Is there anything you want to ask? \n\n\"You can come to me if you have any questions, my cabbages. I'm your friend.\"\n\n\"We can't trust your answer,\" Valentine interjected.\n\nRyan shot him a look, signaling him to calm down.\n\nLumian smiled.\n\n\"So you can completely trust the others?\"\n\nLeah was at a loss for words, while Ryan thought for a moment before responding, \n\n\"Actually, we can't completely trust anyone. We have to make a comprehensive judgment based on the answers we get from different people and the situation we observe.\"\n\n\"That's more like it.\" Lumian spread his hands. \"Well, then it wouldn't hurt to hear my answer. At least it's a reference.\"\n\nRyan was silent for a moment before glancing around. \n\nThe early morning in Cordu was bustling with people heading to the farmlands, but there was hardly anyone near Ol' Tavern.\n\n\"Here's the deal,\" he said finally. \"We're here to find someone.\"\n\n\"The padre?\" Lumian asked with a smile.\n\nRyan shook his head. \n\n\"No. We visited the padre to find this person.\"\n\n\"Who is it?\" Lumian asked with interest. \"I know everyone in the village. I should be able to help.\"\n\nRyan did not show any joy.\n\n\"Actually, we don't know who this person is, how old they are, or what they look like.\n\n\"We received an unsigned letter some time ago, and we're trying to find the person who wrote it.\"\n\nLumian couldn't help but wonder if the letter was from an informer. \n\nHe feigned puzzlement.\n\n\"Did the person who wrote the letter not reach out to you after you arrived in the village?\"\n\n\"No,\" Leah replied for Ryan.\n\n\"Perhaps they don't feel safe and don't trust you?\" Lumian suggested eagerly. \"Can't you glean any clues from the contents of the letter?\"\n\nLumian was curious about the letter's contents. \n\nIf it was targeting the padre's crew, he'd be happy to help them. But if it involved Aurore, he'd urge his sister to move. After all, Aurore communicated with her pen pals frequently, and if any of them were caught, she could be implicated. The letter could be a crucial clue.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 19": "Lumian subconsciously held his breath and shrank back a little.\n\nNaroka did not come in this direction. Slowly, she entered the small forest and disappeared into the deep night.\n\nLumian was slightly worried. She doesn't seem right\u2026 Did something happen? \n\nRecently, there had been more and more abnormalities in the village.\n\nHe looked outside for a while, and the night had returned to silence. Only the swaying leaves proved the existence of the wind.\n\n\"What are you looking at?\" Aurore's voice suddenly came from behind him.\n\nLumian turned around and was delighted to see his sister, who was wearing a two-piece pajama set. \n\n\"Did you also notice something wrong?\"\n\n\"No,\" Aurore replied, her blond hair slightly messy and fluffy from just waking up. \n\nThen she added angrily, \"I don't see anything wrong. All I know is that there's a guy who's up in the middle of the night, loitering at the window.\"\n\n\"It'll be dawn in an hour tops. How can it be considered the middle of the night\u2026\" Lumian muttered out of habit. Then he asked, \"Didn't you come over because of the owl? Didn't you see Naroka outside?\"\n\n\"Naroka?\" Aurore revealed a rare blank expression.\n\nLumian recounted everything from the moment he woke up and realized that there was a black shadow outside the window to the strangely-behaving Naroka walking into the forest.\n\nAs for the special trait he discovered while meditating in his dream, he planned to consult the mysterious woman first before considering how to tell Aurore or hide it for a while to prevent his sister from stopping him from obtaining superpowers.\n\nAurore furrowed her beautiful blond brows. \n\n\"Something might have already happened to Naroka\u2026\n\n\"Go check on them at dawn.\"\n\nLumian asked subconsciously, \"What could have happened?\"\n\n\"How would I know? I didn't see her; there's no way I can make an accurate judgment,\" Aurore snapped back.\n\n\"You really didn't see her?\" Lumian thought that his sister had been monitoring him the entire time.\n\nAurore scoffed. \"Do you think you can see whatever you want? If you see something you shouldn't, you have to consider which graveyard to bury me in. I won't look outside for no reason. I'll just monitor your condition. I'll only wake up if something's wrong.\"\n\nLumian was stunned for a moment and couldn't help but blink. Grande Soeur is taking such a huge risk to watch over me\u2026\n\nAurore added earnestly, \"That's why I'm telling you, don't look at what you shouldn't see and don't listen to what you shouldn't hear. Pursuing extraordinary power is a very dangerous thing.\"\n\n\"Got it.\" Lumian nodded solemnly.\n\nAt the same time, he thought to himself, It's precisely because it's dangerous that I can't let you go at it alone.\n\n...\n\nAfter breakfast, Lumian followed his sister's instructions and headed straight to Naroka's house. \n\nAs he approached, he saw many villagers standing outside the door, including his friends, Ava's father Guillaume Lizier, Reimund's father Pierre Greg, and the padre's younger brother Pons B\u00e9net.\n\n\"What happened?\" Lumian carefully circled around Pons B\u00e9net and the few thugs surrounding him and went to Reimund's side.\n\nReimund replied sadly.\"Naroka passed away.\"\n\n\"Ah?\" Lumian was prepared for something to happen to Naroka, but he didn't expect her to be dead.\n\nReimund rambled on. \"Before dawn, the padre came to give her the last rites. She was still fine and energetic two days ago when we asked her about the legend of the Warlock. Why would she suddenly pass away\u2026\"\n\nBefore dawn? Lumian was alarmed.\n\nHe realized that it was precisely that moment when he saw Naroka. The exact timing of the padre's last rites didn't make much of a difference.\n\nLumian's mind raced with thoughts. So, what I saw was actually Naroka's ghost? This happened after the owl flew over. Can it really take away a human's soul? Yes, Naroka was one of the witnesses to the Warlock incident that happened back then\u2026 If I hadn't listened to Grande Soeur and went out after dark, I might have been the one the padre did last rites with. Heh, his version of it for me is probably spitting at me\u2026\n\nReimund didn't chat with him. He stood outside the two-story house and quietly mourned Naroka.\n\nAfter Lumian reined in his thoughts, he saw Leah, Ryan, and Valentine walking over.\n\n\"Did something happen here?\" Leah asked before Lumian could even greet her. \n\nThey saw many people gathered on the road.\n\nLumian sighed and said, \"My cabbages, an honorable old lady has passed away.\"\n\n\"Then why are all of you standing outside?\" Leah asked without offering any condolences, not fully convinced by Lumian's explanation.\n\nShe was still wearing the same clothes as before.\n\nLumian made an obvious sizing-up gesture, which made Leah panic.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Ryan asked.\n\nLumian smiled. \"You're definitely not Dari\u00e8ge locals.\"\n\n\"We're from Bigorre,\" Ryan answered frankly.\n\nBigorre was the provincial capital of the Intis Republic's Riston Province, while Dari\u00e8ge was a city on the southern border of Riston Province. It covered a large area, including the village of Cordu.\n\nLumian nodded. \"It's no wonder you don't know the customs of the Dari\u00e8ge region.\"\n\nHe had initially thought that these three foreigners were officials from Dari\u00e8ge, but it turned out that they were from the provincial capital, Bigorre. \n\nLumian silently updated his judgment of Leah and company. Looks like their status is much higher than I expected\u2026\n\nLeah asked with interest, \"What kind of customs? Can you tell us?\"\n\nLumian planned on forging a good relationship with them, so he smiled and said, \"You're my cabbages. Why wouldn't I tell you?\n\n\"As you know, everyone has their own corresponding horoscope. And in the Dari\u00e8ge region, we also believe that every family has their own horoscope that determines the amount of providence they receive. The death and funeral of the family, especially the head of the house, will take away such good providence.\n\n\"In order not to affect the horoscope and retain the providence, we will place the deceased in the center of a family before burial, which is the kitchen. Then, we will trim off some of her hair and nails and keep them in the house forever without letting them be discovered by any guests.\n\n\"At such a time, if a person attending the funeral enters the house, it will affect the corresponding horoscope and take away a portion of their providence. Therefore, we attend the funeral by mourning outside. At most, we will look in from the door and wait at the cemetery beside the cathedral.\"\n\n\"I see,\" Ryan nodded in understanding. \"It's the same as how every cathedral in every region has holy bones stored. 'The sage is forever where a part of their body is.'\"\n\nHe turned to face Naroka's house, removed his top hat, placed it against his chest, and began to mourn. \n\nLeah and Valentine also expressed their condolences.\n\nWhen they were done, Lumian said to them, \"I'm going to the door to look at her. I'll see you later, my cabbages.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Ryan replied with a gentle nod.\n\nLumian lowered his voice and added, \"I'll help you find that livre bleu.\"\n\nBefore Leah and the others could respond, he stepped to the side and smiled. \n\n\"Why do you wear the same clothes every day?\"\n\n\"We can't care too much about appearances when we are out in a foreign land for extended periods,\" Ryan explained simply, while Leah subconsciously touched the silver bell hanging from her veil.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to Valentine and the others, Lumian walked to Naroka's door.\n\nHe had to queue for a while before it was finally his turn. \n\nLumian stood by the door and looked at the kitchen ahead.\n\nNaroka's corpse had not yet been placed into a coffin. It was lying quietly on a simple bed made of a few benches. \n\nHer nails had been trimmed, and her thin white hair was much neater than before.\n\nHer face was pale, and her wrinkles deepened the lines on her face. Lumian didn't dare to look at her for too long.\n\nCompared to when I saw her before dawn, her face is even whiter, Lumian thought to himself as he made a slight bow before leaving the door.\n\nOn the way to the cemetery with Reimund, Lumian suddenly slapped his head. \n\n\"Sacrebleu, I forgot to inform Aurore.\"\n\n\"What are you waiting for?\" Reimund asked, understanding the importance of keeping Aurore in the loop.\n\nAurore didn't enjoy being out most of the time. She really wasn't kept in the loop if not for her brother.\n\nLumian saw an opportunity and said, \"Coincidentally, this place isn't far from your place. Lend me your livre bleu for two days. A few pages of mine had been gnawed away by rats, so I need to copy it.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Reimund agreed.\n\nIn any case, there was still some time before the burial.\n\n...\n\nLumian returned home and hid the livre bleu before informing Aurore about Naroka's passing. \n\nShe couldn't help but sigh.\n\n\"As expected, something happened. I wonder if it was caused by that owl\u2026\"\n\n\"I suspect so too,\" Lumian agreed, echoing his sister.\n\nAurore tersely acknowledged and said, \"You must not leave the house after dark. You have to find a way to warn the people who were seeking out the legend of the Warlock with you.\"\n\nLumian had already scared Reimund with Naroka's death, having just asked about the Warlock legend two days ago, and instructed him not to go out after dark for the time being. \"Alright,\" he replied.\n\n\"Naroka is a good person. I'll change my clothes and attend her funeral,\" Aurore said, walking towards the stairs. \"Do you want to come with me, or do you want to read some books and do a test set before going?\"\n\nWhy am I still doing test sets at a time like this? Lumian couldn't quite understand his sister's train of thought. \n\nConsidering that he had to compare the livres bleu, he said to Aurore, \"I'll do a paper before I go.\"\n\n\"Very good.\" Aurore was rather pleased.\n\nAfter Aurore left, Lumian's expression darkened. \n\nHe went up to the second floor and entered the study. He took out the livre bleu that he had borrowed from Reimund and compared it to the one at home where part of the words had been cut out.\n\nTime slowly passed as Lumian pieced together the corresponding words one by one and wrote them on a piece of paper. \n\nHe made adjustments according to the length of the two sentences, and soon the contents of a possible request for help appeared in front of him: \"We need help as soon as possible. The people around us are getting weirder.\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 20": "It was the dead of night, and all was quiet.\n\nLumian stirred in his dream once more. The first thing he glimpsed was a faint gray mist.\n\nOn impulse, he reached into his shirt pocket with his hand.\n\nThe frigid sensation of cold, hard metal immediately registered in his mind.\n\nHe retrieved the object he'd felt. A glint of gold illuminated his eyes.\n\nIt was a gold coin.\n\nA Louis d'or.\n\nIt's still here\u2026 Lumian sat up and peered down at himself.\n\nHe still donned the cotton attire, pants, and leather jacket from his last expedition. The nearly two-meter-long steel pitchfork and sharp, iron-black axe rested within arm's reach.\n\nThis was precisely the same condition as when he'd exited the dream.\n\nIn other words, this dream is persistent. It doesn't reset with each entry\u2026 Lumian fiddled with the Louis d'or and slipped it into his cotton shirt's inner pocket.\n\nThough it couldn't be actualized, it was still a joy to have.\n\nLumian rose from bed and gazed out the window for a spell, ensuring the red mountain peak in the ruins hadn't changed.\n\nHe hoisted his axe and pitchfork, departed his chamber, and entered the dimly lit corridor.\n\nAurore's bedroom and study doors remained ajar.\n\nLumian studied them briefly, then suddenly conceived an idea.\n\nIn the dream, my room is practically identical to reality. It contains all the expected elements. Aurore's room appears the same at first glance.\n\nHowever, can I locate her witchcraft notebook, secret potion formula, or learn how to become a Warlock in her quarters?\n\nThis notion was akin to a devil's whisper, causing Lumian's heart to race. He was tempted to try.\n\nCompared to exploring the unknown, hazardous, enigmatic ruins, sifting through Aurore's room was the simpler, safer option.\n\nNo, no! Lumian shook his head vigorously and cast the idea aside.\n\nHe'd rather take his chances than violate Aurore's privacy. He wouldn't venture into her bedroom without her approval.\n\nThis was due to his respect for Aurore.\n\nIf it weren't for Aurore, he would have perished as a child on the streets five years ago.\n\nLumian withdrew his pained gaze and made his way to the stairs.\n\nIf the occupant of the room wasn't Aurore, he would have already delved in to search for useful information.\n\nOnce downstairs, Lumian didn't hasten his departure. Instead, he inspected the provisions in the kitchen.\n\nThe olive oil, corn oil, and animal fat that Aurore had amassed were neatly arranged in buckets and cans, just like in reality.\n\nAlmost instinctively, Lumian lifted the bucket of corn oil and positioned it near the stove.\n\nHis sole reason for selecting it was that animal fat and olive oil were pricier.\n\nThen he adeptly kindled a blaze in the hearth with coal and wood, and fashioned a couple of torches to ignite.\n\nHe was preparing to incinerate that monster.\n\nNaturally, it would be preferable if there were other options. That was a last resort.\n\nAfter completing these tasks, he retrieved his axe, opened the door, and departed.\n\nLumian then observed something unusual.\n\nThe faint gray mist that suffused the dream felt more humid than before. The ground beneath his feet was also slightly muddy.\n\nIt rained? This place persists and develops naturally according to certain laws when I'm absent or dreaming? Lumian was somewhat taken aback, but he had an inkling that it was only fitting.\n\nRecalling Aurore's bizarre tales, he suddenly had a notion.\n\nThis can't be the real world, can it?\n\nMy dream is connected to the genuine world. That tarot card enables me to traverse the barrier between dream and the ruins while conscious?\n\nLumian swiftly surveyed his surroundings and realized that an endless gray fog bordered both sides of the ruins, on the dream's periphery.\n\nI'll check later. I won't venture into the ruins. I'll stroll out of the gray fog and see if it's a surreal and irrational dream after passing through the gray fog, or if there's tangible land, sky, village, and town\u2026\n\nIf it were the former, it signified that this place was still a dream. If it wasn't, Lumian had to confirm which world this was.\n\nHe surmised that based on the usage of the Louis d'or, this place still appeared to be in the Intis Republic, but it might not be the present era. It could be a location that had vanished decades or centuries ago.\n\nHowever, Lumian sensed that there was a high likelihood that he wouldn't be able to exit the encompassing gray fog.\n\nHe gathered his thoughts and proceeded toward the ruins.\n\nHe didn't forget that the purpose of entering the dream was to attempt to contend with that monster.\n\nAfter traversing a hundred to two hundred meters in the muddy wilderness riddled with gravel and crevices, Lumian abruptly halted.\n\nHe thought of a problem.\n\nHe'd overlooked something in his preparations earlier!\n\nPreviously, his two-story abode lacked any flames. It was quite secure in this world cloaked in gray fog. But now, it had a blazing furnace that emitted light. Would it draw in a swarm of monsters and render the safe zone unsafe?\n\nLumian instinctively turned his head and peered in the direction he'd come from. He observed that a scarlet gleam had been etched on various glass windows at the base of the half-submerged two-story structure in the faint gray mist.\n\nIt was akin to a beacon in the dark world.\n\nConsidering that a considerable amount of time had elapsed, it was evidently too late to attempt to extinguish the fire. Lumian hastened his pace and entered the ruins, taking refuge in the building that had crumbled due to a conflagration.\n\nHe clipped the axe to the back of his belt and agilely scaled a wall, concealing himself in a shadowy nook separated by bricks and timber.\n\nLumian gazed at his home on the other side of the wilderness.\n\nAs time ticked by, he didn't witness any monsters lured by the fire.\n\nSeems like the fire won't trigger any changes. At the very least, my house won't be besieged by monsters\u2026 Lumian breathed a sigh of relief.\n\nThis meant that even if he encountered any peril, as long as he could flee home promptly and slumber as soon as possible, he could successfully elude it.\n\nHe began to contemplate how to entice and eliminate the previous monster.\n\nFrom their brief skirmish, he'd deduced that its strength, speed, reaction time, and agility were similar to his, but he could sense that it fought on instinct. It lacked sufficient experience, expertise, or corresponding intelligence. That's why he'd been able to counter and slay it when it ambushed him\u2026\n\nIt'll also be bewildered and taken aback. It's not dissimilar to humans\u2026\n\nOther than combat techniques, I have two other advantages over it. Firstly, I possess superior intelligence. Secondly, I know how to wield weapons and utilize tools. This is the greatest advantage humans possess over such monsters\u2026\n\nAs long as I'm cautious, defeating it again won't be arduous. The most crucial aspect is how to eradicate it completely\u2026\n\nJust as Lumian was about to deliberately stir up some commotion to see if he could lure over some monster, he spied a figure stealthily approaching the utterly ruined house on the side.\n\nThe figure was crimson and devoid of skin. Its muscles, blood vessels, and fascia were exposed. It was the monster from last time.\n\nUnlike before, this monster was wielding a manure fork.\n\nA manure fork!\n\nIt knows how to wield weapons too... Lumian's countenance stiffened as his expression turned grim.\n\nUnwittingly, his confidence waned a bit.\n\nAs the monster drew closer and turned, Lumian perceived exaggerated wounds on its back, neck, and the nape of its neck. However, the fissures were no longer oozing pus, and it appeared to have mostly mended.\n\nIt's indeed the one I encountered previously\u2026\n\nIts self-healing ability is many times superior to that of ordinary humans\u2026\n\nLumian gasped soundlessly.\n\nHe compelled himself to compose and expeditiously assessed the situation.\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye, Lumian arrived at a determination.\n\nThis was a prime opportunity, and he had to seize it when he encountered it. He couldn't let it slip by!\n\nHe silently retrieved a stone brick beside him and awaited the monster's arrival at the desired location.\n\nIn just a few strides, the monster entered Lumian's kill zone.\n\nLumian abruptly hurled the stone brick at the ground behind the monster.\n\nThud!\n\nThe stone brick clattered, causing the monster to swivel around and scrutinize the assailant.\n\nUpon beholding this, Lumian seized the axe with both hands and pounced fiercely from the wall towards the monster.\n\nBang!\n\nThe axe descended heavily onto the monster's neck, cleaving it in two.\n\nWith twin thuds, Lumian and the monster plummeted to the ground simultaneously.\n\nLumian sprang up nimbly, seized his axe, and darted over, delivering weighty slashes to the monster's neck.\n\nOnce, twice, thrice. The monster didn't even get a chance to resist before its head was lopped off.\n\nAs the head rolled aside, the skinless body convulsed twice and ceased movement.\n\nLumian didn't halt there. He took a diagonal step, rotated his axe, and pulverized the vicious head with its thick back, reducing it to fragments.\n\nSubsequently, he pivoted and hacked at the exposed muscles, blood vessels, and fascia, crushing the heart and other vital organs.\n\nAfter accomplishing all of this, Lumian took two paces backward and surveyed his handiwork. He panted and chuckled softly.\n\n\"I thought you were truly invincible. Who'd have thought you possessed so little ability!\"\n\nAmidst the subdued laughter, the decapitated cadaver abruptly jolted upward.\n\nLumian's pupils contracted, and he instinctively wished to pivot and flee.\n\nHe forcefully quelled this impulse and strode forward once more, brandishing his axe.\n\nAfter the corpse bounced twice, it reverted to immobility, as if it had writhed in vain.\n\nLumian scrutinized it a while longer and ultimately verified that the monster was wholly deceased.\n\nHow tenacious... Lumian sighed inwardly. Then, he leaned over and crouched down. He employed his axe to pry open the muscles and fascias and scrutinized the corpse.\n\nThe monster's bodily structure wasn't dissimilar to a human's, but its muscles were evidently more animated. Even though it was already dead, some of its incisions were still wriggling slightly.\n\nThere's no treasure, nor is there any supernatural power transferred into my body\u2026 Lumian assessed his present state and felt somewhat disenchanted.\n\nThe adage that one grows stronger with each monster they slay indeed only existed in Aurore's tales.\n\nHe then relocated the monster's corpse and head into the ruined building and entombed them with bricks and timber.\n\nSubsequently, he scoured the burnt-down house, hoping to discover something.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 21": "As Lumian left Ol' Tavern, he resumed his surreptitious ways, skulking down the path he always took home.\n\nSure enough, he spotted one of Pons B\u00e9net's goons hiding behind a tree, spying on passersby.\n\nThe padre doesn't know when to quit\u2026 Lumian muttered to himself.\n\nBut Lumian couldn't retaliate. \n\nHis personal abilities were limited, and he couldn't risk bringing attention from the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun in the Dari\u00e8ge region. The Inquisition would be all over him in a heartbeat, which could spell doom for Aurore.\n\nUnless Lumian was pushed to the brink and had no other choice but to abandon the town, his only option was to expose the padre's unsavory activities and force him to retire to a cloister.\n\nBut that was easier said than done. Lumian needed to be careful and cunning, just like when he let the foreigners discover the padre's affair with Madame Pualis.\n\nLumian didn't want to make a big fuss about it. He knew that B\u00e9ost, the administrator and territorial judge, was a stickler for his reputation. If Lumian brought Madame Pualis's predicament to light, he wouldn't get any favors in return. No, it would be more likely that B\u00e9ost would turn on him, filled with bile and vitriol.\n\nThat would leave Lumian with little choice but to flee Cordu, with both the padre and administrator hot on his heels.\n\nHe proceeded with caution, taking a detour through a narrow alley that weaved between several houses. \n\nAlong the way, Lumian relied on his wits and the surroundings to conceal himself. He ducked behind walls, slipped through doors, and took refuge behind trees whenever necessary. As he neared the end of the alley, he heard the sound of voices.\n\n\"Guillaume, why we waste our time chasing zat keed all day? Let's go to Aurore's house tonight and catch him. We 'ave ze advantage of numbers, and Aurore's fightin' skills ain't enough to stop us. We can even get reinforcements from ze city if needed.\"\n\nGuillaume\u2026 The padre is here too\u2026 Lumian stopped, retreating into the corner to eavesdrop on their conversation to see what plans the padre had for him.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net's voice was mesmerizing.\n\n\"Surely, you don't think that's the extent of Aurore's capabilities? I wouldn't be surprised if she had supernatural abilities beyond mine.\"\n\n\"Ah\u2026\" Pons B\u00e9net was obviously surprised. \"A witch, you say? Guillaume, maybe it's time for you to venture to Dari\u00e8ge and seek out ze Inquisition. If you can catch a true witch, ze Church will undoubtedly grant you a great reward. And wiz zat, you may finally attain ze extraordinary strength you've been yearnin' for all zese years.\"\n\n\"Imbecile,\" Guillaume B\u00e9net scolded his brother. \"Don't you know what's happening in this village? The Inquisition has noses like hounds. They won't overlook any anomalies. When the time comes, we'll be in hot water.\"\n\n\"Even if Aurore desires to deal with us, I have other solutions,\" he said. \"We mustn't arouse the Inquisition's attention.\"\n\nSo, what is happening in the village now? Lumian took this seriously and was curious.\n\nCombining his observations of abnormalities, he sensed that something terrible was brewing and developing in the village, like a turbulent undercurrent under the calm sea.\n\nTo Lumian's dismay, Pons B\u00e9net didn't elaborate on the topic. Instead, he focused on something else.\n\n\"Do you 'ave any way to deal wiz a Witch?\"\n\n\"You don't need to know,\" the padre, Guillaume B\u00e9net, responded in a hushed tone. \"Next, we can put aside dealing with Lumian, but we still have to maintain appearances. We can't let anyone suspect my desire for revenge. That will provide the connections the foreigners need and have a negative impact. What you need to do now is to remind each relevant person and scare those yokels who might notice. Don't let them spill the beans in front of those foreigners.\"\n\n\"Guillaume, you mean zat zose foreigners are 'ere to investigate zat matter?\" Pons B\u00e9net appeared fearful and concerned.\n\nLook at you. All brawn, no brains. You're nothing like your brother, a natural-born leader\u2026 Lumian mocked Pons B\u00e9net inwardly.\n\nDespite his disdain for the padre, whom he saw as a crude and greedy stallion rather than a man of the cloth, Lumian couldn't deny that he had a certain rugged charm. His direct, domineering style and clear mind won over the masses in the countryside, making it easy for them to idolize and rely on him.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net sneered.\n\n\"No need to worry. So long as those foreigners don't find any real evidence, I'll still be the padre of Cordu.\n\n\"Pons, you need to understand that ruling through fear and intimidation won't lead to peace or prosperity. The Church doesn't want a ruined town that can't pay taxes. We need friends and followers to maintain control. By offering them protection, we can gain their support.\n\n\"The Church trusts us locals with our relatives, friends, and followers to handle matters here and doesn't bring in outsiders who could make a mess. As long as there's no solid evidence, the higher-ups will continue to believe in me.\n\n\"Alright, I'm off to the cathedral.\"\n\nThat does sound logical and persuasive, but your wisdom and insight are limited to Dari\u00e8ge\u2026 Aurore told me that when the Church confronts villages that are overrun with evil gods, they obliterate them entirely and raze the land to the ground. They don't just slay the adults, but even the kids\u2026 Lumian found himself almost swayed by Guillaume B\u00e9net's words. Luckily, Aurore had warned him about the fearsome reputation of the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun and the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery.\n\nAfter the padre departed, Lumian took a different path and made it back home unscathed.\n\nAurore, clad in a pristine apron, bustled about the oven.\n\n\"What are you up to?\" Lumian inquired with curiosity.\n\nIt was still two hours to lunchtime.\n\nAurore tucked a strand of her blonde locks behind her ear and beamed, \"Trying out a new toast recipe. Rice bread.\"\n\n\"You don't have to go through all this trouble\u2026\" Lumian was moved to his core.\n\nHe believed Aurore was going out of her way to make something special just for him.\n\nAurore giggled and retorted, \"What are you thinking? Can you be any more self-absorbed?\"\n\n\"For me, baking is a form of amusement. It's a great way to pass the time. You get it?\"\n\n\"Then why don't you like going out? There's plenty of fun out there,\" Lumian probed. He always felt Aurore was a homebody because she was too concerned about the risks her Warlock status posed.\n\nAurore swiveled her head and shot him a withering glare.\n\n\"You mean drinking and gambling?\"\n\n\"Remember, I'm my own person, not relying on or attaching to others.\"\n\nLumian grasped the first half of her statement but was at a loss with the latter.\n\n\"Ah? Could you expound on that?\"\n\nAurore gave him a deadly glare.\n\n\"Long story short, your sis is a major introvert most of the time!\"\n\n\"What do you mean by most of the time?\" Lumian queried, confused.\n\n\"Humans are walking contradictions,\" Aurore mused, turning back to the oven. \"Don't you recall? Sometimes, I'm a chatterbox, eager to venture out and listen to the old ladies' gossip. Other times, I'll play with the kids and regale them with tales. Every so often, I'll cut loose and ride Madame Pualis' horse around the mountains, hollering at the top of my lungs.\"\n\nAt the time, you shone like a dew-kissed rose, luring people in only to prick them\u2026 Lumian couldn't help but grumble to himself.\n\nSince Madame Pualis was mentioned, Lumian decided to change the subject.\n\n\"Aurore, uh, Grande Soeur, I heard a rumor about Madame Pualis.\"\n\n\"What is it?\" Aurore did not hide her curiosity.\n\n\"She's a Warlock who can talk to the dead\u2026\" Lumian related to his sister what Ava had divulged. He also brought up the anomaly he'd observed and Guillaume B\u00e9net's comments.\n\nAurore halted her work and listened to her brother's account intently.\n\nHer mien grew noticeably graver.\n\nAfter Lumian had finished, Aurore offered him a smile and assuaged his fears.\n\n\"Don't fret too much. Those three foreigners must be here for something that the padre and his comrades did in secret. It might have to do with Madame Pualis.\n\n\"Don't mess with Madame Pualis for now. I'll keep an eye on them.\n\n\"Explore the village more, mingle with those foreigners, and try to suss out what's going on. Heh heh, compared to that, the lady who gave you the Wand card is far more intriguing.\n\n\"If things do deteriorate, we must contemplate departing Cordu. We can start making arrangements now.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Lumian nodded in agreement.\n\nAfter a brief silence, he inquired curiously, \"Aurore, if we must depart Cordu, where do you envision moving to?\"\n\n\"Trier!\" Aurore declared without hesitation.\n\nTrier was the capital of the Intis Republic, the apex of culture and art across the continent.\n\n\"Why?\" Despite considering Trier himself, Lumian posed the question casually.\n\nEvery Intisian coveted a chance to visit Trier.\n\nIn the eyes of the Triers, there were only two types of individuals in Intis: Triers and outsiders.\n\nAurore responded nonchalantly, \"A prophet once said, 'As long as Trier endures, mirth and glee will never falter<span tabindex=\"1\">1.'\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 22": "As Lumian stepped out the door, he felt as thought he was transported to another world.\n\nBefore him lay no longer the familiar Cordu, but a dark-red mountain peak and the collapsed buildings surrounding it. Together, they formed a strange ruin.\n\nThe fog in the sky was thick and pale, making it difficult for light to enter. The ground was shattered and there were many rocks. Lumian gripped his axe tightly and inched forward carefully, his heart pounding in his chest. Along the way, he couldn't find a place to hide.\n\nThere were no weeds or trees.\n\nLumian walked in fear, his every sense on high alert. All he could do was hunch his back and comfort himself. At the very least, if there was any danger in this area, it would be obvious at a glance. He could discover it in advance.\n\nFinally, he arrived at the ruins, a half-collapsed building that had been wrecked by fire.\n\nLumian surveyed the area for a moment and tentatively confirmed that there were no other creatures lurking about. Satisfied with his assessment, he cautiously made his way inside the building, being mindful of the charred wood that could fall at any moment from midair.\n\nAs he searched the room, his eyes landed on a broken pot in the corner of the house. There was a hint of gold shining through the cracks.\n\nLumian approached the pot slowly and realized that it was a gold coin.\n\nCan it be true? There's actually treasure in the ruins of my dream? He picked up the gold coin and wiped it against his body. \n\nThe patterns on the surface of the coin were revealed.\n\nThe coin featured a man's portrait carved on the front. His face was thin, and his hair was parted 30-70. There was a mustache on his lips, and his gaze was rather firm. On the back was a bunch of sweet iris flowers surrounding the number 20.\n\nLumian recognized the man depicted on the coin. It was none other than the first president of the Intis Republic, Levanx.\n\nIt's actually a Louis d'or\u2026 Lumian was rather surprised.\n\nFirstly, he couldn't believe that the currency in this strange dream ruin was actually the currency of the Intis Republic in reality. And secondly, he had casually picked up something as valuable as a Louis d'or.\n\nHe knew that in the present day, the legal currencies of the Intis Republic were verl d'or and coppet. One verl d'or was equivalent to 100 coppet.\n\nCoppet existed in the form of copper coins and silver coins. The copper coins were divided into three categories: 1 coppet, 5 coppet, 10 coppet, while the silver coins had the denominations of 20 coppet and 50 coppet.\n\nVerl d'or could be found in the form of silver coins, gold coins, or banknotes. In silver coins, there were denominations of 1, 5, and 10 verl d'or, while gold coins came in 5, 10, 20, 40, and 50 denominations.\n\nThe denominations of banknotes were even more varied, ranging from 5, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1,000 verl d'or.\n\nIn reality, the people of Intis still clung to the old currency units. For example, the most widely used 5 coppet copper coins were known as 'lick.'\n\nSimilarly, gold coins worth 20 verl were commonly referred to as Louis d'or.\n\nIn the old currency era, Louis d'or had been known as Roselle. But after the Republic was established, the name was changed to Louis d'or in order to erase Emperor Roselle's influence.\n\nAs Lumian understood it, even in the rural area of Cordu, a Louis d'or could sustain a poor family with fields for an entire month. \n\nHe knew that without Aurore's high income, he might never have even seen what a Louis d'or looked like. In fact, in the entire village of Cordu, only the siblings and the family of the administrator had ever seen or owned a Louis d'or.\n\nTo any villager, this Louis d'or was an incredibly valuable gain.\n\nUnfortunately, this is just a dream\u2026 Lumian couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment.\n\nThis was something ordinary, making it unlikely he could \"bring\" it out of the dream.\n\nBut even so, he handled the Louis d'or with great care and respect. Having spent much of his life wandering, he knew the value of every coppet.\n\nAnd he knew that one Louis d'or was equivalent to 2,000 coppet, which was equal to one gold pound in the Loen Kingdom, though slightly less. According to the papers he had read, 24 verl d'or could only be exchanged for one gold pound.\n\nLumian continued his search for any written information that could shed light on the ruins and their history. He wanted to see if this place corresponded to a certain location in reality, and whether a village in the Intis Republic had been \"transported\" into this dream world. The appearance of the Louis d'or had only fueled his curiosity.\n\nAs Lumian moved cautiously through the ruined building, his eyes fell upon a spot where a stove had once stood, now stained with a dark red color.\n\n\"Blood?\" His pupils dilated as he quickly made a guess.\n\nImmediately after, he made a judgment.\n\nAlthough it wasn't fresh, it hadn't yet turned black\u2014it looked as though it had just dripped there two or three days prior, or perhaps even more recently!\n\nAs his heart began to race, Lumian suddenly felt the light around him dim, as if something had silently blocked the light filtering through the dense fog from above!\n\nThe memory of past attacks flooded Lumian's mind like a turbulent wave, causing him to react instinctively. \n\nWithout a thought, he lunged forward and wrapped his body in midair, rolling on the ground to avoid any potential danger.\n\nThump!\n\nA loud thump echoed through the air as something heavy fell behind him. \n\nLumian quickly rolled to the left side of the dilapidated stove, using a nearby rock to leverage himself around.\n\nAs he rose to his feet, axe at the ready, he saw an additional figure standing where he had just been moments before. \n\nThe dim light made it difficult to discern whether it was human or some kind of humanoid creature.\n\nThe figure hunched in front of Lumian was unlike anything he had ever seen before. It was a monster, with no clothes or shoes to speak of. Its skin had been peeled off, revealing the red muscles, blood vessels, and yellowed fascia beneath. Sticky liquid dripped from its body, yet it didn't fall to the ground.\n\nIt was a monster!\n\nIts eyes seemed to be embedded in its face, and its mouth hung open with all its might, revealing uneven teeth and a long drool of saliva.\n\nDespite all the ghost stories Lumian had fabricated in the past, he never expected to encounter such an evil spirit in real life.\n\nWhoosh!\n\nThe stench of blood filled Lumian's nostrils as the panting of the monster filled his ears.\n\nInstinct took over Lumian as he dodged to the side, narrowly avoiding the blood-red monster's attack.\n\nLumian knew that he had Aurore's guidance and years of experience fighting on the streets to thank for his quick reflexes. Without them, he might not have been able to react in time.\n\nTaking a deep breath to calm himself, Lumian charged after the monster that had pounced on him. With his sharp axe in hand, he swung with all his might and struck the monster in the back.\n\nBang!\n\nLumian's axe felled the monster mid-turn, sending a spray of pus and blood in every direction.\n\nWithout a moment's hesitation, Lumian knelt down on one knee and raised his axe again, ready to strike another blow.\n\nBang! Bang! Bang!\n\nAgain and again, Lumian swung his axe with precision and force, each strike slicing through the monster's flesh and leaving deep, wide cracks on the back of its head, neck, and back.\n\nFinally, the monster lay still, defeated by Lumian's fierce barrage of blows. \n\n\"Huff! Puff! You don't act as terrifyingly as you look.\" Lumian heaved a sigh of relief, his voice tinged with a hint of mockery.\n\nHe wiped his face with his left hand, then used it to wipe off the blood on his other hand. \n\n\"Is this monster's bodily fluids poisonous? For the time being, there's no pain of the fluids eating at me\u2026\" Lumian began to worry about another problem.\n\nJust as Lumian mustered up his courage and was about to search the monster's body, he was caught off guard by a sudden movement. The skinless, blood-colored monster propped itself up with both hands and bounced up again, as if it were still alive.\n\nIt isn't dead yet?\n\nDespite being slashed to such a state, it seemed that the monster was still alive.\n\nLumian was shocked and afraid.\n\nFear and trepidation took hold of Lumian.\n\nIf Lumian had been facing normal humans, beasts, or monsters, he would not have been so afraid, even if he couldn't defeat them. But this monster in front of him seemed unkillable, rendering Lumian's every move useless.\n\nTaking advantage of the monster's brief disorientation, Lumian made a quick decision. He propped himself up with his feet, exerted strength on his knees, and ran wildly.\n\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n\nHe ran with all his might, but he could feel the monster's breath on the back of his neck, and the sound of its heavy breathing echoed in his ears.\n\nThe monster followed closely behind him.\n\nDespite his fear, Lumian gritted his teeth and allowed his fear to push himself \n\nto run even faster, surpassing his previous limits.\n\nTo his delight, he soon realized that the distance between him and the monster was no longer shortening.\n\nThud! Thud! Thud!\n\nLumian finally reached his semi-subterranean two-story building as he pulled open the unlocked door and jumped inside.\n\nWith a loud clang, he slammed the door shut and quickly made his way to the stove, where he picked up a steel fork that was leaning against the wall. \n\nThen he focused on the door.\n\nBut then, he heard the sound of the monster's running footsteps fading away. He waited, but the monster didn't try to slam through the door.\n\nIt knows that I'm lying in ambush here? Lumian couldn't believe that the monster had higher intelligence.\n\nHe slowly moved towards the window near the door and peeked out.\n\nSuddenly, a face appeared on the glass\u2014a bloody, skinless mess with uneven teeth. \n\nLumian froze for a moment, his heart almost stopping.\n\nTo Lumian's surprise, the monster didn't try to break the glass or attack him. Instead, it simply met his gaze.\n\nLumian snapped out of his daze and retreated, brandishing the long fork with both hands.\n\nThe monster left the window.\n\nLumian watched cautiously, observing its movements as it lingered in the light fog for a while before finally retreating back to the ruins. \n\nLumian was at a loss.\n\nHe had been prepared to trap the monster and make a quick escape from the dream, but the creature had simply left without attacking.\n\nAfter some thought, a possibility occurred to Lumian. Perhaps the monster is afraid to enter my house?\n\nYes, there's no signs of damage to the house at all\u2026\n\nIn the dream, this is an absolutely safe place?\n\nWith this realization, Lumian felt a sense of relief wash over him. \n\nLumian was hit with a wave of exhaustion the next second. \n\nThe short chase had taken more out of him than an entire afternoon of combat training. \n\nLumian made his way upstairs to his bedroom, clutching the pitchfork and axe tightly in his hands. As he lay down on the bed, Lumian attempted to fall asleep.\n\n...\n\nLumian opened his eyes, feeling disoriented and groggy. \n\nOutside the curtains, it was still dark, and the room was shrouded in shadows.\n\nFor a moment, Lumian couldn't tell if he was still in the dream world or if he had somehow returned to reality. But then he noticed the lack of gray fog and the fact that he was wearing his pajamas, and he realized that he must have woken up.\n\n\"I woke up early because of the fright,\" Lumian muttered to himself, subconsciously patting the pocket of his pajamas. But when he didn't feel the weight of the Louis d'or, he felt a pang of disappointment.\n\nIt confirmed another fact\u2014that money couldn't be brought out of the dream world!\n\nLumian took a deep breath and composed himself, his thoughts turning to a serious problem: \n\nHow was he supposed to deal with that unkillable monster?\n\nWhile Lumian knew that he could bypass the area and enter stealthily, he also knew that this was not a long-term solution. The possibility of encountering similar monsters in the future was always there, and he couldn't afford to risk his life by being unprepared.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 23": "As the night settled in, Lumian finished dealing with his neighbors who had come to borrow the oven. He made his way up to the second floor, entering the room that served as Aurore's study.\n\nIn Cordu, many folks were destitute and couldn't afford their own ovens or large stoves. When they needed to toast bread or smoke meat, they had to borrow it from others and use it on the spot.\n\nAurore had always been lenient and accommodating when it came to this. Anyone could borrow her oven, but they had to pay the fuel costs or bring their own coal and wood.\n\nCurrently, she had donned her white silk nightdress and was curled up in a reclining chair, her focus solely on the book she held under the bright battery-powered lamp on the desk.\n\nLumian didn't wish to disturb her, so he nonchalantly pulled out a thinner book from the bookshelf and took a seat in the corner.\n\nHidden Veil\u2026 What kind of magazine is this? Lumian pondered, gazing at the cover that was adorned with cryptic symbols.\n\nHe swiftly flipped through the pages, and the more he read, the more he was taken aback.\n\nThis magazine delved into the very existence of the human soul. It discussed how all beings had a spirit, and through secret methods of communication between different spirits, one could obtain various kinds of aid.\n\nEven if one wasn't devout, even if they only attended the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral to pray and partake in Mass occasionally, two words couldn't help but flash through Lumian's mind: Sacrilege! Taboo!\n\nAs a Warlock who would undoubtedly be burned at the stake by the Inquisition if her true identity was exposed, it was customary for Aurore to have such books at her residence. However, Lumian could tell that this magazine had received the government's permission for publication!\n\nCan such a thing be openly published?\n\nDidn't they say that publication censorship had always been very strict?\n\nOr is this a fake permit\u2026 Lumian looked up at Aurore and inquired, \"Is this a prohibited magazine?\"\n\nAurore took her eyes off her book and glanced at her brother. She responded in a nonchalant tone, \"In the past, it was underground fiction. Later on, for some reason, it cleared the censors and was officially published. The Eternal Blazing Sun Church actually didn't care and tacitly agreed.\"\n\n\"Fiction?\" Lumian was taken aback by his sister's choice of words.\n\n\"Of course, it's fiction. You're not taking it seriously, are you?\" Aurore laughed. \"If what's written is true, do you think it can still be published? If you follow the method written on it, other than making yourself mentally weak and neurotic, there won't be any additional gains. Yes\u2026 there will occasionally be something real, but without the corresponding ritual language, it'll be a waste of effort no matter how hard you try.\"\n\nThis was the professional evaluation of a Warlock.\n\n\"Alright\u2026\" Lumian couldn't hide his disappointment. \"I just find it strange that this can be published.\"\n\nAurore took a deep breath, her puffed-up cheeks accentuating her pondering.\n\n\"I don't know why either. Perhaps it's because the world has been seeing an influx of supernatural events lately, and it's becoming increasingly difficult to conceal them. The public is becoming more aware of their existence, and the government is slowly easing its grip on such topics. That's why books like these are being published. In Trier, Psychic, Lotus, and Arcane are the most popular magazines. I have them all on my bookshelf. If you want to come up with more realistic stories for the tavern, you should give them a read.\"\n\n\"Oui,\" Lumian responded eagerly, his interest piqued.\n\nSimultaneously, he let out a wistful sigh deep in his heart.\n\nAurore's hoard of books was truly impressive and diverse!\n\nThanks to these tomes and Aurore's occasional elucidations, Lumian\u2014a lad who had forsaken his schooling\u2014had managed to acquire a reasonable comprehension of the world, continent, and nation he called home.\n\nThe world was divided into two great continents, one to the north and one to the south, separated by the treacherous Berserk Sea, where raging hurricanes battered any who dared to sail its waters. But the truly mysterious lands lay to the east and west, on the legendary Eastern and Western Continents. No one had ever set foot there, and some wondered if they even existed at all.\n\nLumian and Aurore lived in the Intis Republic, a land situated in the heart of the Northern Continent. It was a nation bordered by the Fog Sea to the west, the Feysac Empire to the north, and the Hornacis mountain range and the Loen Kingdom to the east. To the south lay the Feynapotter kingdom, Lenburg, and Masin.\n\nThe small countries nestled between the Feynapotter Kingdom and the Loen Kingdom, such as Segar, together with Lenburg and Masin, were collectively known as the countries of the south-central region. They shared a common faith in the God of Knowledge and Wisdom.\n\nThe Southern Continent had already fallen under the dominion of the various powers of the Northern Continent. Whether it was the Balam Empire, the Paz Kingdom, the Haagenti Kingdom, or any of the other nations, they had all but lost their autonomy. Yet still, a fierce resistance against colonization burned in the hearts of the conquered.\n\nIn addition to the Berserk Sea dividing the Northern and Southern Continents, there were other great seas: the Fog Sea to the west of the Intis Republic, the Sonia Sea to the east of the Loen Kingdom, the North Sea to the north of the Feysac Empire, and the Polar Sea to the south of the Southern Continent. They were collectively known as the Five Seas.\n\nOf all the nations of the Northern Continent, the Loen Kingdom was the strongest, with the Intis Republic close behind. The Feysac Empire, defeated in the last war, had fallen to fourth place. The Feynapotter Kingdom had risen to third place. And among the countries of the south-central region, Lenburg reigned supreme.\n\nCompared to the simple folk in Cordu who only knew of the Intis Republic, the Feynapotter kingdom, and Lenburg, Lumian was practically a cartographer.\n\nIt was no surprise really, considering the Cordu Village shepherds only traveled to their neighboring kingdoms of Feynapotter and Lenburg. They only had a limited understanding of these lands. The people in the northern villages of the Dari\u00e8ge region were just as provincial. Other than the surrounding settlements, they could only name Trier, Suhit, and a few other metropolitans.\n\nLumian was often baffled. How did Aurore come by such vast knowledge?\n\nAll the textbooks he read were penned by Aurore, and all his practice exams were prepared by her. Aurore had an answer for every question in the books he read!\n\nBut what stunned him even more was her expertise in various forms of combat.\n\nIt was simply mind-boggling that a woman in her twenties could accumulate so much wisdom. Some people couldn't amass that much knowledge even after living 50 or 60 years.\n\nCould it be that these are the building blocks of a true Warlock? Lumian looked up again and gazed at Aurore, lost in thought.\n\nAs Aurore patted her cheeks while reading, she hardly seemed like a scholar or a warlock.\n\nAurore caught Lumian's gaze and demanded, \"What are you ogling at?\"\n\nLumian quickly changed the subject, \"Last time you mentioned that I possess the knowledge required to pass the college entrance examination?\"\n\nAurore pondered for a moment before responding, \"In theory, you could gain admission to any university, but since I never took that particular exam, I can't say for certain what questions will be asked. Roselle sure did a number on the populace. Sigh, I guess it's a good thing\u2026\"\n\nUndoubtedly, Emperor Roselle's reign spawned the college entrance examination, and it has remained a fixture of academic life to this day.\n\nAurore's mind suddenly shifted gears. She shot Lumian a sly grin and inquired, \"Why did you not make your usual stop at the tavern today to regale the patrons with your tales?\"\n\n\"I'm not truly an alcoholic,\" Lumian replied while flipping through his magazine. \"Reading at home is equally enjoyable.\"\n\nAnd it helps to calm my nerves and ease my mind\u2026 Lumian silently added.\n\nAurore nodded and glanced over at Lumian's spot in the corner of the room.\n\n\"Why are you sitting so far away, putting on an act of pitifulness, weakness, and helplessness?\"\n\n\"Come closer. You need proper lighting to read at night, otherwise, your eyes will suffer.\"\n\nAurore sure has a way with words, Lumian mused. Although I understand the meaning behind \"pitifulness,\" \"weakness,\" and \"helplessness,\" it's still an odd combination. Supposedly used to her idiosyncrasies by now, Lumian retrieved a chair and moved closer to the desk where Aurore sat. \n\nThe two of them spent the evening reading in silence, occasionally chatting, as the sound of their breathing mingled with the rustling of pages and the soft breeze that wafted in from outside the window. Peaceful and soothing.\n\n...\n\nAs he bid Aurore goodnight, Lumian slipped back into his quarters. \n\nHe peeled off his coat and draped it across the back of the chair. He couldn't risk bringing the Wand card to bed with him; that would only raise suspicion, and his sister had sworn to keep a watchful eye on him at all times.\n\nJust as he was about to approach the bed, Lumian froze, his heart skipping a beat. \n\nHis sharp eyes darted around the room, and he adjusted the chair that was usually positioned at a diagonal angle to face the window.\n\nThen, he crawled into bed and extinguished the kerosene lamp resting on the cabinet next to him.\n\nAs he drifted off into the depths of slumber, Lumian was suddenly startled awake.\n\nThe bedroom was shrouded in a dense, gray fog.\n\nLumian, who was already mentally prepared, calmly took in his surroundings and made a realization.\n\nThe chair that he had meticulously arranged before retiring for the night was still positioned at an angle in his dream, just as it had been in reality in the past.\n\nThis suggested that the dream world he had entered was not an exact reflection of reality. Perhaps it was a manifestation of his deepest subconscious desires. Although Lumian couldn't decipher its meaning, he knew that it was something to be remembered.\n\nHe walked over to the window, placed his hands on the sill, and gazed out.\n\nThe mountain made of brownish-red stones and reddish-brown soil, and the collapsed buildings that surrounded it, were still present.\n\nThe eerie silence of the place was deafening.\n\nTime quickly passed. After much contemplation, Lumian made a firm decision.\n\nHe would embark on a preliminary exploration of the area tonight!\n\nHis past life on the streets had turned him into a man of action. \n\nHe didn't rush downstairs, however. Instead, he opened the cabinet and began to pile on clothes. \n\nHe didn't need them to keep warm, but he wanted to increase his \"defense ability\" in this way. \n\nHe grabbed a cotton shirt, cotton pants, and a leather jacket, stretching his body to feel the fit. Any more clothing would only hinder his agility, and that was crucial in a situation like this.\n\nAs he adjusted to his current state, Lumian had a sudden thought. \n\nThis is my dream. Can't I get whatever I want?\n\nWith that intention, he muttered to himself, \"I want a breastplate and a revolver\u2026 I want a breastplate and a revolver\u2026\"\n\nThe room was still shrouded in a thin, gray fog.\n\nThis won't do. This dream is special\u2026 His disappointment was palpable, but he quickly regained his composure and made his way to the bedroom door. Stepping out into the corridor, he found himself in complete darkness. It was murky and dim.\n\nLumian pushed open the door to Aurore's bedroom and then her study. The layout was slightly different from reality, but he recognized it immediately. The biggest difference, of course, was that Aurore was nowhere to be found. The entire scene was frozen in shades of gray.\n\nThe first floor was no different. \n\nLumian scanned his surroundings, searching for a weapon to defend himself. He knew his home better than anyone else and quickly found two viable options.\n\nThe first was a two-meter-long fork made of steel. Aurore had said that it was effective and outstanding as long as the target didn't have a long-range weapon.\n\nThe second was a sharp, iron-black hand axe.\n\nAh, why not both\u2026 Lumian couldn't help but think of Aurore's oft-repeated phrase, but he quickly dismissed the idea. \n\nToday was all about reconnaissance. He needed to be sly, hidden in the shadows.\n\nLugging around a cumbersome weapon would only hinder his movements and give him away.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Lumian stooped down to retrieve the axe. \n\nHe rose to his full height and set off towards the door, barely visible in the misty haze.\n\nWith a deft hand, he opened the door, not making a sound.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 24": "Lumian didn't have the luxury of resting for too long. He had to keep moving, for fear that other monsters might come. After taking a moment to catch his breath, he endured the pain in his neck and back and slowly approached the monster's corpse. \n\nHe held the axe tightly in his right hand, ready to strike again if the creature wasn't fully dead. \n\nAfter cautiously searching the body with his left hand, he found three copper coins called \"lick\" and an empty cloth bag.\n\n\"That's it?\" Lumian muttered to himself, disappointed that he hadn't found anything related to superpowers. \n\nIf it wasn't for that, would he have risked his life fighting this monster?\n\nIf Lumian wasn't special in the dream, he would have been nothing more than the monster's meal. \n\nHe propped himself up and looked towards the shotgun monster's head that had rolled to the side, praying that what he was searching for was there.\n\nIn that moment, a deep crimson glow materialized over the monster's body. \n\nThey resembled fireflies, gradually converging towards a single spot in an unyielding fashion.\n\nLumian gawked in disbelief, as a sense of elation began to well up inside of him. \n\nThis phenomenon had to be connected to superpowers!\n\nWithout much delay, a sticky, dark red substance materialized on the monster's chest, and no additional light specks came into view. \n\nLumian cautiously crouched down and made a grab for the blob. \n\nIt was incredibly slippery, slipping through his grasp twice before he finally managed to hold it in his palm.\n\nIt's remarkably lightweight, yet possesses a certain texture and elasticity. The surface feels as smooth as glass\u2026\n\n\"What the hell is this?\" Lumian muttered to himself, realizing once more that he was completely illiterate when it came to matters of the mystical.\n\nIn the midst of hushed whispers, Lumian caught a whiff of something strange and dark-red that reeked of blood. His impatience grew, and an indescribable malice took over his body.\n\nFor a moment, he wanted nothing more than to raise his axe and hack at the monster's corpse until his violent emotions were spent.\n\nBut Aurore's warning about the dangers of pursuing superpowers echoed in his mind, and he quickly reined in his impulses. He had taken precautions to monitor himself and remain vigilant at all times, and he wouldn't let his guard down now.\n\nIt affects my mind? Lumian tossed the dark red blob into the cloth bag he had found on the monster.\n\nThe moment he lost contact with it, he felt a wave of calm wash over him, dissipating the remaining excitement of the deathmatch. \n\nHis body still trembled slightly, but he was back in control.\n\n\"As expected!\" Lumian whispered happily as he returned to his senses. \n\nHe tied the cloth bag tightly and secured it to his belt buckle.\n\nAfter a moment's consideration, Lumian withdrew the cloth bag and stowed it safely in the inner pocket of his leather jacket. \n\nIt provided him a sense of assurance and minimized the chances of losing it!\n\nAs the buttons on his clothes were undone, the book that had been plastered to Lumian's back lost its support and hit the ground. \n\nIt was riddled with potholes and in tatters, a far cry from its former state. \n\nLumian recognized it as the \"Mock Examination Papers for Higher Education Admission\" exercise book that his sister Aurore had prepared for him. This was the same book that had saved his life by blocking a shotgun attack.\n\nOf course, this single book didn't deserve all the credit.\n\nLumian picked up the exercise book and sauntered back to the monster's lifeless body, a wry smile on his face.\n\n\"See, knowledge is indeed power!\" he said, intending to throw it at the monster's face. But then he hesitated, recalling the countless hours Aurore had spent writing it. He couldn't bring himself to toss it away.\n\nInstead, he tucked the exercise book into his belt, dragged the monster's corpse to the trap, and flung it inside. Lumian kicked the monster's head for good measure.\n\nWith the battlefield cleared, Lumian gathered his tools, including the empty shotgun, his pitchfork, and shovel, and retreated into the wilderness. \n\nHe looked over his shoulder as he walked, ever-vigilant.\n\nEventually, he made it back to his house, climbed the stairs, and entered his bedroom.\n\nIt was only then that he truly relaxed. The agony that had been gnawing at his body, the obvious discomfort, and the overwhelming exhaustion all erupted at once. \n\nHe slumped down on the bed, taking a moment to recover. But he didn't want to sleep just yet. He needed to assess the damage. Lumian stripped off his clothes and walked over to the wardrobe, checking himself out in the full-body mirror.\n\nHis neck was swollen, and the five bloody finger marks on it had turned an ominous shade of bluish-black. His back was bruised, and there were countless scrapes and cuts all over his body. \n\nEven some of my injuries are internal, just like Aurore had warned me. I wonder if I'll recover by the next time I come in? He couldn't help but reflect on the battle. It was a failure, but not a total failure.\n\nIn the first half of the battle, he gave himself a pat on the back. Not only did he make full use of the monster's low IQ to lead it into the second trap, but he also followed his original plan to a tee. It was a game of cat and mouse, and he played it to perfection. He dragged the monster out until it was on the brink of surrendering to its injuries. However, his lack of experience was his downfall. Instead of throwing in heavy rocks, he chose to stab the monster with a pitchfork at the bottom of the pit.\n\nIn the second half of the battle, he was overconfident and underestimated the monster's intelligence. His insufficient combat experience made him fall into the monster's trap, which almost got him killed. \n\nThat performance would have been a disaster. Thankfully, his earlier successes had pushed the monster to its limit, and it didn't kill him quickly enough. This gave him a chance to complete his meditation and summon his \"special trait\".\n\nBefore this battle, Lumian had not expected the \"special trait\" to have such a powerful effect. It caused the monster to descend into uncontrollable fear, one so unbreakable despite suffering attacks. \n\nHe had worried that the near-death state brought about by summoning the \"special trait\" would make him vulnerable to attack. \n\nBut it turned out to be special and very strong\u2026 As Lumian sighed, he had a revelation. \n\nThe monsters in the ruins avoided his house and made it a \"safe zone\" because there was something even more terrifying inside. It could be the owner of the mysterious voice he heard when he summoned the \"special trait\"!\n\nLumian gasped at the thought.\n\nHis subconscious urged him to search every corner of the house for the terrifying thing, but he quickly dismissed the idea. \n\nProvoking the being that even the shotgun-wielding monster was helpless against was not an option.\n\nFor now, all was calm and peaceful, and it was best to keep it that way. He had to maintain the current state of the \"safe house\" and not uncover the shroud. \n\nEach passing day was a day, and as for the dangers that may lie ahead, he would face them when the time came.\n\nNot until then, not until I become a Beyonder and gain significant power. Lumian cast his gaze at the cloth bag in his left hand. \n\nEven as Lumian examined his injuries in the mirror, shirtless, he refused to let go of the source of superpowers. He had worked too hard to obtain it.\n\nHow should I use this thing? he asked himself, opening the cloth bag and staring at the dark red blob within.\n\nThe blob lay still at the bottom of the bag, its form unstable yet clearly not alive. \n\nLumian, who knew nothing of mysticism, wondered if he should eat it, perform a ritual to merge with it, or offer it to some secret entity.\n\nHe only knew of the latter two options from reading Hidden Veil. In the past, he would have only thought of one thing: \"Eat!\"\n\nLumian didn't rush to make a decision. He intended to seek counsel from the enigmatic lady at Ol' Tavern first. \n\nHe was convinced that the woman would provide him with clues on how to harness the power of the dark red sphere and gain superhuman abilities. \n\nLumian sensed that the other party had a reason for doing so, despite not knowing what it was.\n\nIf things didn't pan out, he could still count on his sister for help. \n\nAfter dressing leisurely, Lumian stowed the lump of crimson in his coat pocket, along with all the cash he'd acquired.\n\nFinally, he collapsed onto the bed, too drained to move. Despite the agony in his neck, back, and body, overwhelming fatigue seized him, and he drifted off to sleep in a flash.\n\n......\n\nAs Lumian opened his eyes, he was blinded by the sunlight that had already penetrated the curtains, illuminating the entire room. \n\nSlowly sitting up, he felt sore all over, as if he had been pummeled in a dream.\n\nI was indeed beaten up badly\u2026 The injuries in the dream really get reflected into reality, but there's an obvious level of weakening\u2026 Trying to move around, he felt his muscles aching a little but was ultimately relieved that he wasn't too affected.\n\nHowever, when he reached into his pockets\u2014\n\n\"Nothing\u2026 Nothing at all!\" Lumian failed to exit with the crimson blob.\n\nHis expression became solemn, his brows knitted tightly. Lumian didn't know what to do. \n\nThe crimson blob, an item that promised superpowers, hadn't followed him into reality. This was different from what the mysterious woman at Ol' Tavern had said.\n\nLumian gathered himself, quickly changed his clothes, and left his room.\n\nAs he walked down the hall, he noticed that the door to the washroom was wide open. Aurore was facing the mirror, brushing her teeth with a serious look on her face.\n\n\"Morning,\" Lumian greeted.\n\n\"It's not early anymore. You got up late\u2026\" Aurore muttered incoherently.\n\nSplat! Her blond hair, tied back into a ponytail, flicked about as she spit out the liquid in her mouth.\n\nShe turned to look at Lumian. \n\n\"What did you do wrong last night?\"\n\n\"That owl is outside. How would I dare go out?\" Lumian responded calmly.\n\n\"That's true.\" Aurore dropped the topic and said, \"Remember to take five verl d'or to the administrator to send a telegram later.\"\n\nLumian nodded.\n\nThis was the key to their escape from Cordu, and it was something he would never forget.\n\nAfter breakfast, Lumian headed straight to the village square where the administrator's office was located in a two-story building.\n\nUpon reaching the office, Lumian discovered that Administrator B\u00e9ost had yet to arrive, but the rest of the staff had already commenced their day's work. \n\nLumian paid the required fee and promptly sent a telegram. After concluding his business, Lumian turned on his heel and began walking towards the Ol' Tavern. \n\nIt was highly unlikely that the enigmatic woman was already up and about, but Lumian was more than happy to bide his time.\n\nHis pursuit of superpowers had been a prolonged one, so a few more ticks on the clock didn't faze him.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 26": "Lumian's subconscious gaze darted around the room, taking in the familiar sights of the table, the chair, the bookshelf, the wardrobe, and the bed. \n\nIt was his bedroom, but it was cloaked in a thin, gray fog.\n\nIs this some sort of lucid dream? I'm having a lucid dream? His pupils dilated as the realization dawned on him.\n\nA lucid dream was a rare occurrence where one's mind could think and remember like in a state of wakefulness while still in a dream state. It was a skill that required specialized training to master.\n\nAurore had tried various methods to induce lucid dreams in order to unravel the secret of Lumian's gray fog dream and help him eliminate the latent danger it posed, but she had failed.\n\nBut now, Lumian found himself inexplicably conscious in his dream. \n\nAs the shock of the situation passed, he began to consider the possibility of why this had happened.\n\nCould it be because of the tarot card that represents the Seven of Wands?\n\nThat woman said it would help me unlock the secret of the dream..\n\nTherefore, its function is to allow me to enter a lucid dream state and explore the area enveloped by the gray fog?\n\nHmm\u2026 Compared to my previous impression, the gray fog seems to have faded a lot. A lot more\u2026\n\nWith these thoughts racing through his mind, Lumian rose from his chair and strode to the side of the room. He placed his hands on the table against the wall and gazed out the window, where a completely unfamiliar landscape greeted his eyes.\n\nThis dream did not replicate the Cordu where he lived.\n\nUnder a thin, ghostly fog, a towering mountain peak caught Lumian's attention. It rose up twenty to thirty meters into the air, constructed from brownish-red stones and reddish-brown soil.\n\nBuildings surrounded the mountain, now in ruins, either fallen or charred beyond recognition. \n\nThey resembled crypts, a disordered cemetery surrounding the mountain's base.\n\nThe ground was marred by holes and scattered with gravel. Not a blade of grass or a single weed could be found in this barren wasteland.\n\nThe fog in the sky thickened to an impenetrable white, with no indication of a sun. Lumian could only see as if in the dead of night, under the light of the stars.\n\nAfter a moment of observation, he murmured to himself, \"That's it? This is the dream that's been haunting me for years?\"\n\nBut soon he refocused his thoughts on a more practical question: \n\nWhere is the dream secret hidden? \n\nOn the peak, or in one of these shattered buildings?\n\nLumian did not rush to leave his bedroom and explore the dream. Instead, he stayed put, scanning the area from his vantage point.\n\nSuddenly, he caught sight of a figure darting through the ruins of the buildings surrounding the mountain peak.\n\nDespite the fog's thinness and the two-story house's limited height, Lumian couldn't shake the sense of its presence. He wondered if he was hallucinating.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Lumian muttered to himself, \"Stay calm. Be patient. Stay calm. Be patient.\"\n\nFrom what I can see, this dream is shrouded in secrecy, and it doesn't feel entirely my own. Lumian knew that blindly exploring it could lead to danger.\n\nYes, I will search for that woman tomorrow and see what information I can find. Then, I will make a decision\u2026\n\nLost in thought, Lumian withdrew his gaze and prepared to exit the dream to rest in peace. \n\nHowever, he didn't know how to wake himself up while being awake.\n\nAfter numerous attempts to awaken, he laid in bed and attempted to clutter his thoughts, trying to recreate the state he was in while sleeping.\n\nAfter an indeterminate amount of time, Lumian abruptly sat up and noticed the faint glimmer of golden sunlight filtering into the room through the curtains.\n\nI'm finally awake\u2026\n\nAs expected, sleeping within the dream restores my disoriented state. Then, I can escape\u2026\n\nLumian breathed a sigh of relief and whispered to himself.\n\nIn that moment, a knock reverberated through the door.\n\n\"Aurore?\" Lumian's heart clenched, fearing the worst.\n\n\"It is moi,\" Aurore's voice infiltrated the room.\n\nLumian sprung from the bed and rushed to the entrance. He grabbed the handle and pulled it open.\n\nLo and behold, it was Aurore standing outside. She donned a white silk nightgown, and her long tresses of golden hair cascaded elegantly down her back.\n\n\"How did it go?\" She appeared certain that Lumian had just awoken.\n\nLumian held nothing back and recounted every detail that had occurred.\n\nAurore nodded pensively.\n\n\"The purpose of the card was to facilitate a lucid dream\u2026\"\n\nShe inquired, \"What are you going to do next?\"\n\nLumian grunted curtly.\n\n\"I shall grab a bite to eat before visiting the woman and attempting to gather more information to discern her true intentions.\"\n\n\"Very well.\" Aurore offered no objection.\n\nShe added, \"I shall also pen a letter to someone inquiring about the dream you recounted and the symbols therein.\"\n\nAt this juncture, she glimpsed Lumian's suddenly apprehensive expression and smiled.\n\n\"Fret not, I shall make adjustments. I shall not jettison everything at once. After all, I am the one who instilled in you the principle of gradual progress.\"\n\n\"Well, when you converse with that woman, do not be aggressive. Endeavor to be amicable. It is not that we are fearful of her, it is simply better to acquire another ally than an additional adversary.\"\n\n\"Understood,\" Lumian replied solemnly.\n\n...\n\nCordu, Ol' Tavern.\n\nLumian strode into the Cordu, Ol' Tavern and approached the bar counter. He leaned in and spoke to Maurice B\u00e9net, the tavern owner who also doubled up as a bartender.\n\n\"Which chamber does the foreign madame occupy upstairs?\"\n\nOl' Tavern, the only inn in the village, boasted six rooms on the second floor for guests to rest their weary heads.\n\nMaurice B\u00e9net was not a burly man. Like most in the village, he had raven locks and blue eyes, but his nose was always red, a consequence of his heavy drinking.\n\nHe was related to the Church's padre Guillaume B\u00e9net, but the two were not close and were merely distant cousins.\n\n\"Why the inquiry?\" Maurice B\u00e9net inquired, his curiosity piqued. \"What business would a big-city woman have with a country bumpkin like you?\"\n\nThere was an obvious look of inquiry on his face. Maurice had a sixth sense for these things, especially when it came to men and women. \n\nLumian scoffed, \"Aren't you a country bumpkin and a hillbilly yourself?\" He casually made up a reason, \"The lady lost something last night. I found it this morning. Just trying to return her property.\"\n\nMaurice B\u00e9net didn't buy it for a second. \"Is that so?\"\n\nEight out of ten things that came out of Lumian's mouth were lies. \n\n\"What else? Do you think she'll fall for me?\" Lumian said, undaunted.\n\n\"That's true.\" Maurice B\u00e9net was convinced. \"She's in the room by the square, opposite the washrooms.\"\n\nAfter Lumian left, Maurice polished a glass, eyes tracking him. He whispered, just barely audible to Lumian, \"Impossible? Not always. Sometimes people want to try something new\u2026\"\n\n...\n\nLumian found the washroom on the second floor, the only spot of light in the dim, narrow hallway. But his eyes were drawn to the door across from it. A piece of paper hung from the brass handle, stark white against the dark red wood.\n\nScrawled on it in Intis: \"Currently resting. Do not disturb.\"\n\nLumian read the note for a few seconds. Instead of rushing forward to knock on the door, he took two steps back and stood against the wall. \n\nHe planned to wait here until the lady came out.\n\nLife on the streets had taught him hard lessons. When an opportunity appeared, you seized it with both hands, no hesitation, no second thoughts, no fear. Otherwise it slipped through your fingers, and you were right back where you started. So he would wait as long as it took, the minutes ticking by endlessly as he ignored the eyes he felt tracking him, the whispers in his mind. \n\nHe stood there without a hint of frustration, probably capable of passing off as a statue.\n\nFinally, a soft creak.\n\nThe woman had changed into a pale green dress with white edges. Her brown hair was swept into a tight bun.\n\nThose light-blue eyes flicked to Lumian before moving to the paper sign on the door handle, a smile dancing at the corner of her mouth.\n\n\"How long did you wait?\" she asked, not at all surprised to see him there.\n\nLumian took a step forward and said, \"That's not important.\"\n\nHe tried to keep his tone even, to appear less eager.\n\n\"What do you want to ask?\" the woman said, cutting straight to the point.\n\nLumian glanced around the empty hallway. \"Here?\"\n\nThe lady replied with a smile, \"If you don't mind, I don't mind either.\"\n\nLumian had already noticed that the other occupants of the tavern, including Ryan and Leah, were nowhere to be found. There was no one else on the second floor except for him and the woman in front of him.\n\nLumian asked, organizing his thoughts carefully.\n\n\"What's the secret in that dream of mine?\"\n\nThe lady laughed involuntarily.\n\n\"That's for you to answer, not me.\"\n\nShe paused for a moment before saying, \"All I can say is, you'll find extraordinary power there.\"\n\nExtraordinary power\u2026 His pulse roared in his ears. \n\n\"What's the point, if it's just a dream? Won't change anything out here.\"\n\nThe woman's lips curled into a smile.\n\n\"Who's to say what's possible, in the realm of the extraordinary? Perhaps, it can?\"\n\nAfter everything, the power I crave is there for the taking? Lumian's breath caught.\n\nThe grin slid away as the lady added seriously, \"But danger lurks there too. Die in the dream, you die out here.\"\n\nDie in the dream, die for real? Lumian didn't understand, but he chose to believe it.\n\nThat dream clung to Lumian like a shadow, as it had for years. But it was different, somehow. Special. And Aurore's voice whispered in his memory: \"Careful's never a bad idea.\" Lumian preferred to view the situation as challenging and the consequences as severe. He couldn't afford to underestimate the danger or be careless.\n\nAfter a few seconds, he asked, \"If I stay out? What then?\"\n\n\"Theoretically speaking, there won't be any consequences. No one will force you,\" the woman said thoughtfully. \"But as time passes, I can't be sure that the situation won't change. And the probability of things going wrong is much higher than things going right.\"\n\n\"How much higher?\" Lumian pressed. \"90% to 10%?\"\n\n\"No, 99.99% to 0.01%.\" The lady added seriously, \"Of course, this is just my personal judgment. You can choose not to believe it.\"\n\nLumian felt a wave of uncertainty wash over him, his mind racing with conflicting thoughts.\n\nRecently, I'm becoming convinced that the dream is a hidden danger. Not caring is the worst choice\u2026\n\nBut if I really want to explore it, there's a very high chance that an accident will happen without any knowledge\u2026\n\nShould I wait for Aurore to gather more information from her pen pals before making an attempt?\n\nBut if I do, Aurore definitely won't allow me to use the dream exploration to obtain extraordinary powers\u2026\n\nWasn't my investigation of the legend to seek extraordinary powers?\n\nIt's too risky. It can lead to death\u2026\n\nPerhaps I should do a preliminary exploration at the edge of the dream ruins to gather information and not take the risk of entering? \n\nHmm, I can tell Aurore about the conversation, but I can't reveal the possibility of obtaining extraordinary powers\u2026\n\nOnce his thoughts had settled, Lumian gazed at the woman across from him and asked in a low, serious tone, \"Who are you exactly? Why did you give me that tarot card and the opportunity to explore the dream?\"\n\nThe woman smiled enigmatically. \n\n\"I will tell you once you have unraveled the mystery of the dream.\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 25": "The lady nibbled on a croissant before answering Lumian's question. \n\n\"I do.\"\n\nShe really knows\u2026 Lumian's heart leapt with hope. He deliberated over his words before asking, using honorifics to show his respect, \"May I offer to pay a certain price to commission your help in solving Cordu's problem?\" \n\nFrom his point of view, this mysterious lady woman was much stronger than Leah and her companions. If she agreed to help, the problem with Cordu would be solved, and he and his sister wouldn't have to risk their lives to escape. But he was worried that he couldn't afford the price.\n\nLumian wasn't optimistic that the woman would agree to help. But he felt it was necessary to try. Even if he was rejected, he wouldn't be too embarrassed. He was not a stickler for such things.\n\nThe woman turned to him and spoke calmly, \"I can indeed solve the problem here, but the corresponding price is that everything will be destroyed, including you. \n\n\"If you want a better outcome, you can only rely on yourselves.\"\n\nLumian's eyes widened in disbelief. Could the problem with Cordu be that serious? He searched the woman's face for any sign of jest, but found none.\n\nHe wasn't surprised or disappointed that she refused to help. What shocked him was the severity of the problem. It could even lead to the destruction of the entire village!\n\nHe was puzzled and alarmed by the situation. Since she can resolve it, why is it that the entire village will die, while us ordinary people and Beyonders who aren't strong enough capable of producing a better outcome?\n\nIf he didn't hear back from Novel Weekly by the day after tomorrow, he would urge his sister to leave Cordu immediately. He couldn't delay any longer even if it meant taking a huge risk! He had to act fast!\n\n\"What's the problem?\" Lumian pressed, his dignity never a priority.\n\nThe lady smiled.\n\n\"Me telling you and you finding out through your investigations will give rise to completely different results.\"\n\nLumian gritted his teeth instinctively. He didn't stand her behavior of always holding back something.\n\nFor some reason, he sensed that peculiar feeling in the woman's eyes, something he couldn't quite put his finger on.\n\n\"Okay.\" Lumian paused for a moment, weighing his words carefully. \"Do you have any information about Madame Pualis? Is she a Warlock\u2014uh, a Beyonder?\"\n\nThe woman lifted her coffee cup to her lips and took a small sip before answering, \"Yes, she is.\"\n\nIndeed\u2026 Lumian asked further, \"What pathway, which Sequence?\"\n\nThe lady's expression turned serious in an instant. \n\n\"It's not a normal pathway.\"\n\n\"What do you mean it's not a normal pathway?\" he pressed.\n\nThe lady smiled.\n\n\"You'll find out later.\"\n\nI want to know now\u2026 Lumian struggled to keep his expression in check.\n\nAlready standing and about to leave, Lumian suddenly remembered something crucial.\n\n\"Madame, how am I supposed to bring those supplementary ingredients into the dream?\"\n\nIn the dream ruins, he could only find basic ingredients like red wine and basil in the dream ruins, but for the Red Chestnut Flower and poplar leaf, he would have to collect them in reality.\n\nThe task wasn't impossible, and Lumian had already thought of a way to \"borrow\" them, but he knew it would all be for naught if he couldn't transfer them to his dream.\n\nThe lady smiled and said, \"I'll offer you a little assistance again, free of charge.\n\n\"Find those materials in reality, put them on the table in your bedroom before you sleep. I'll help you send them into your dream.\"\n\nShe can send those things into my dream? Lumian was first shocked before feeling a wave of relief wash over him. At least his problem was solved.\n\nHe never thought he'd encounter someone else with the ability to \"enter\" the special dream world like he could. \n\nLumian couldn't shake the feeling that his ability to enter dream ruins had something to do with the cryptic symbols etched onto his chest. As he gazed at the woman before him, he couldn't help but wonder if she was connected to those same markings or that bizarre and terrifying voice that had been echoing in his mind.\n\nLumian had just left the Ol' Tavern and had plans to collect the Red Chestnut Flower and poplar leaves. \n\nBut as he turned the corner, he saw Ryan, Leah, and Valentine exiting the back door of the tavern. They were still dressed in the same clothes and outfits.\n\nLumian's heart skipped a beat as he greeted them with a smile. \n\n\"Good morning, my cabbages.\"\n\nLeah turned her head and laughed amidst the tinkling sounds.\n\n\"You're early, too.\"\n\nLumian tried to act sneaky and looked around before speaking in a hushed tone. \n\n\"I noticed something unusual yesterday.\"\n\nRyan's expression turned serious as he exchanged glances with Valentine and Leah. \n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nLumian's voice quivered slightly as he spoke. \n\n\"I suspect that Naroka's death is abnormal. You attended her funeral yesterday.\"\n\nRyan gave Lumian an encouraging look to continue, and Lumian took a deep breath before proceeding with his suspicions.\n\n\"I told you about the funeral customs in the Dari\u00e8ge area, didn't I? After everyone went to the cemetery, Pons B\u00e9net entered Naroka's house without any objection from the owner.\n\n\"Isn't this destroying the influence of their family's horoscope and taking away the corresponding good luck? \n\n\"There must be something wrong!\"\n\n\"Pons B\u00e9net, the brother of the padre?\" Ryan thought for a few seconds and asked.\n\nLumian nodded heavily.\n\nAs Lumian thought about the padre's strange group and his impending departure from Cordu, he realized he had nothing to fear from speaking his mind. With a deep breath, he declared, \"The padre is not a good man!\"\n\n\"Why do you say that?\" Leah asked with a grin, clearly unsurprised by Lumian's criticism of the padre.\n\nNot one for formalities, Lumian launched into a detailed account of a villager who had snitched in Dari\u00e8ge and subsequently vanished. His focus was on the accusations against the padre, and he held nothing back.\n\nFinally, he said, \"I really question how he's a clergyman of the Church.\n\n\"One time, I said something that was deemed too real, and I had to hide temporarily in the cathedral. \n\n\"I was about to doze off behind the altar when the padre walked in with Madame Pualis. And let me tell you, they were doing the dirty deed right under the deity's gaze.\n\n\"In the conversation that followed the deed, the padre even lamented to Madame Pualis, saying, 'Why can't a man marry his sister?'\n\n\"Madame Pualis was appalled by his words and begged the padre to repent.\n\n\"However, the padre said, 'Many wealthy families lose their fortunes when their daughters marry and their sons start families. But if a son could marry his sister, these problems would disappear. Unfortunately, the law and morals don't allow it'\u2026\"\n\nThe frigid Valentine's face contorted with anger at the news.\n\n\"Is he a servant of God or a servant of the Demon?\"\n\nRyan nodded as if in thought.\n\n\"No wonder Pons B\u00e9net hasn't been able to start a family despite being married after all these years\u2026\"\n\nLeah surveyed Lumian as she chuckled. \n\n\"You knew about Madame Pualis and the padre's affair. You wanted to use us that day.\"\n\nLumian's smile was uneasy, but his tone was resolute. \n\n\"As a believer of the Eternal Blazing Sun, I cannot tolerate such a person in the cathedral.\"\n\nThe cold Valentine's expression softened, and he nodded approvingly. \n\n\"If only Cordu had more people like you.\"\n\nA few more like me? Lumian shuddered at the thought of Cordu overrun with more people like him.\n\nHe continued, \"That time, I overheard the padre warning Madame Pualis that he was planning something and might be targeted by the Inquisition. He told her to be careful and keep quiet.\"\n\nRyan's expression turned solemn.\n\n\"Did he say anything more about it?\"\n\n\"No.\" Lumian didn't fabricate the matter.\n\nHe couldn't risk saying more than that. If he did, trouble could erupt tonight. He wasn't even a Beyonder yet.\n\nAfter bidding farewell to the trio of foreigners, Lumian spent hours gathering Red Chestnut Flowers and poplar leaves.\n\nAs the sun neared its apex, Lumian arrived at the village square and made his way to the two-story building where official business was conducted.\n\nMost of the villagers had already gathered, eagerly awaiting the selection of the Spring Elf, an important part of the upcoming Lenten celebration tomorrow.\n\nSqueezing through the crowd, Lumian spotted Reimund, Ava, and the others.\n\n\"Is Ava on the list?\" he asked.\n\nAva remained silent, her agitation palpable. Reimund shook his head. \"We don't know.\"\n\n\"She must be on it,\" interjected Guillaume Berry, a frequent companion of Lumian and the others. \"Among the unmarried women in the village, other than your sister, she's the most beautiful. Your sister doesn't meet the age requirements.\"\n\nHe was the Guillaume-junior that Lumian and the others were talking about. He hung out with them frequently. Guillaume had curly brown hair and prominent freckles on his face. His blue eyes seemed to narrow because they weren't large enough.\n\nAva's cousin, Az\u00e9ma, also stood nearby, looking much like Ava but smaller and less striking.\n\nShe remained silent, but Lumian sensed her desire to be chosen as the Spring Elf as well.\n\nIn the Dari\u00e8ge area, being chosen as the \"Spring Elf\" was a coveted honor that not only recognized a person's beauty and character but also came with hidden benefits.\n\nUpon hearing Guillaume-junior's words, Lumian grinned. \n\n\"If Ava's not on the list, I'll shout, 'I vote Ava!' when the administrator finishes reading it.\"\n\nAva blushed. \"You don't have to do that.\"\n\nIt was a normal process for villagers to shout out additional candidates after the administrator finished reading the list of nominees for the Spring Elf. However, not many had the nerve to do so. Lumian, however, was not one to shy away from such things.\n\nHe had no misgivings about this.\n\nAva will be the one being embarrassed, not me.\n\nShortly after, Administrator B\u00e9ost appeared at a second-story window, looking far more put-together than the padre. His neatly combed brown hair, light blue eyes with black lines, straight nose bridge, thin lips, and well-groomed mustache conveyed his status, accentuated by his double-breasted flannel coat.\n\nHe gazed down at the assembled villagers for a moment before speaking. \n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's time. Those who are late will no longer have the right to vote. \n\n\"Next, I'll read the list of candidates for the Spring Elf.\"\n\n\"Ava Lizier\u2026\"\n\nAs B\u00e9ost read out the list, Ava breathed a sigh of relief. \n\nUnsurprisingly, she received over 80% of the votes.\n\nAfter the voting, Lumian made an excuse about needing to go home and left without celebrating with his companions.\n\nUpon arriving home, he immediately asked his sister, \"Did we receive a reply?\"\n\nIf they had, the telegrapher would have delivered it and collected a fee.\n\n\"Not yet,\" Aurore replied, shaking her head. \n\nShe then said, \"The undercurrents have been turbulent lately. You can't let your guard down during combat practice. Speaking of which, we'll spar in the afternoon.\"\n\nLumian winced, feeling sore all over.\n\nBut then an idea struck him. He put on a pained expression and said, \n\n\"I don't know if it's because I've been training too hard, but my whole body hurts today. Aurore, uh, sister, can you give me a massage? You're the most skilled at it.\"\n\nAurore nodded. \"Sure, I can do that.\"\n\n......\n\nUnder the skilled hands of his sister, Lumian's body finally began to recover that night. \n\nBefore drifting off to sleep, Lumian placed three Red Chestnut Flowers and some powdered poplar leaves in a bottle on the table in front of the window.\n\nHe gazed at the bottle for a long moment, his heart beating with anticipation and nervousness, before finally crawling under the covers.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 27": "Kirsch. As expected of someone from a big city\u2026 Lumian's gaze eventually landed on the glass in the lady's hand.\n\nThe distilled spirit made from sugar and fermented cherries had a color and texture that appealed to the ladies. Of course, they could replace the cherries with other fruits, but it would alter the taste only slightly.\n\nCordu's Ol' Tavern had a limited stock of high-grade wine, including Kirsch, which Madame Pualis fell in love with during her visit to the provincial capital, Bigorre. \n\nMadame Pualis was the wife of B\u00e9ost, the local administrator and territorial judge. Her noble ancestors had lost their title during Emperor Roselle's reign. \n\nLumian knew that she was also one of the mistresses of the padre, Guillaume B\u00e9net, but not many people in the village knew about it.\n\nLumian shifted his gaze away from the lady and walked towards the bar counter. \n\nA man in his forties wearing a linen shirt and trousers of the same color was sitting there. His brown hair was no longer lush, and his face was creased from years of hard labor.\n\nHe was none other than Pierre Greg, Reimund's father.\n\nAnother Pierre.\n\nAt least a third of the people at the bar would answer to the call of Pierre, Lumian had joked earlier in front of Leah, Ryan, and the others.\n\nIn the village, when people talked about Pierre or Guillaume, they had to specify which family they were referring to. \n\nMany families had fathers and children with the same names, making it impossible to tell them apart without adding \"p\u00e8re,\" \"a\u00een\u00e9,\" or \"junior\" to their names.\n\nReimund sauntered up to his father's side and asked, \"Papa, why don't you go to the square and chat with the others?\"\n\nThe men in the village always convened under the ancient elm tree or in someone's abode, where they'd spend the day playing dice, cards, chess, and swapping all sorts of rumors\u2014the tavern cost money, after all.\n\nPierre Greg, with a glass of rich red wine in hand, turned to his second son and said, \"We'll go later. There shouldn't be many people at the square now.\"\n\nThat's right. Where did all the men in the village go? Lumian was immediately perplexed.\n\nHe had noticed the absence of the village men at the square.\n\n\"Monsieur, I want to ask you something,\" Lumian said bluntly.\n\nPierre Greg immediately turned alert.\n\n\"A new prank?\"\n\nThe story of \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf\" does indeed have a basis in reality\u2026 Lumian turned his head, gesturing for Reimund to speak.\n\nReimund hesitated for a moment, gathering his thoughts. \n\n\"Papa, how long ago did the Warlock legend you told me happen? The one where it took nine bulls to pull the coffin.\"\n\nPierre Greg gulped down a mouthful of wine, his brow furrowed in puzzlement. \n\n\"Why are you asking this?\n\n\"You know, your p\u00e9p\u00e9 told me this when I was just a wee lad,\" Reimund replied.\n\nThe Riston Province, where Cordu was located, and the neighboring provinces of Aulay and Suhit were located in the south of the Intis Republic. They were famous grape producers, and the wine here, especially the inferior ones, was very cheap. In some years, people could even drink wine like water.\n\nReimund was disappointed because it had been a long time since his grandfather had passed on.\n\nSuddenly, Pierre Greg chimed in, \"Your p\u00e9p\u00e9 claimed that he saw it with his own two eyes when he was but a young man. It spooked him so much that he became deathly afraid of owls. He was convinced that their evil talons could snatch his very soul away.\"\n\nLumian and Reimund's eyes sparked with excitement, almost in unison.\n\nMerde, there were actual clues!\n\nThe legend of the Warlock\u2014it was something that someone had actually experienced?\n\n\"Did P\u00e9p\u00e9 mention anything about where the Warlock lived or where he was buried?\" Reimund asked eagerly.\n\nPierre Greg shrugged. \"Who cares?\"\n\nNot one to be deterred, Reimund persisted, determined to glean any shred of information. Before he could speak, Lumian intervened with a gentle touch on his shoulder as he spoke loudly, \"The river awaits us.\"\n\nReimund was just about to take his leave with Lumian when Pierre Greg suddenly remembered something.\n\n\"Hold up, Reimund. You'll soon be a Greenwatcher, won't you? There's something you need to be aware of.\n\nGreenwatchers had the crucial responsibility of patrolling the highland pastures around the village and nearby fields to prevent any illegal grazing during the prohibited period or livestock from ravaging the saplings.\n\nLumian didn't pay much heed to the conversation and made his way to the tavern's washroom.\n\nAs he exited the restroom, he took a detour to the female foreigner who was sipping on Kirsch. It was impossible to discern her age.\n\nAlthough he had no intentions of striking up a conversation, he observed her with great detail. It might come in handy in the future, just like how he had used Ryan, Leah, and Valentine to infiltrate the padre's scandalous scene.\n\nAfter a few subtle glances, Lumian was poised to head for the entrance of the tavern to wait for Reimund when the languid lady in the orange dress looked up.\n\nBefore Lumian could retract his gaze, his eyes met hers.\n\nLumian felt a little awkward as his thick skin couldn't protect him from the unexpected encounter.\n\nMany thoughts immediately surfaced in his mind.\n\nMaybe I should take a cue from the padre and administrators of the Church and praise her beauty? Or perhaps I should switch gears and hit on her? Alternatively, should I show my inexperience and hastily turn around to leave?\n\nAs Lumian made up his mind, the lady interrupted his thoughts and said with a smile, \"Been having dreams, have you?\" \n\nLumian was hit by a bolt of lightning. His thoughts went numb and his mind froze.\n\nAfter a moment or two, he managed to force a smile and asked, \"Dreaming isn't unusual, is it?\"\n\nThe woman touched her cheek with one hand and sized Lumian up. She chuckled and said, \"Lost in a misty dream, perhaps?\"\n\nHow could she know? Lumian's pupils dilated instantly, and his expression betrayed a hint of fear.\n\nDespite having experienced many things, he was still young, and for a moment, he couldn't control his emotions.\n\nStay calm, Lumian. Stay calm\u2026 He repeated to himself, trying to relax the muscles on his face, before asking, \"Did you hear the tale I told those three foreigners last night?\"\n\nThe woman didn't reply. Instead, she pulled out a stack of cards from her orange purse, which sat on the chair next to her.\n\nShe cast her gaze at Lumian once again and broke into a radiant smile.\n\n\"Draw a card. Perhaps it can aid you in unlocking the hidden secrets of that dream.\"\n\nWh\u2014 Lumian was taken aback, his guard instantly raised.\n\nHe was both enticed and wary.\n\nHe looked down at the card she presented him and furrowed his brows.\n\n\"Tarot?\"\n\nThe card resembled the tarot cards created by Emperor Roselle for divination.\n\nThe woman looked down sheepishly and offered a self-deprecating smile.\n\n\"My apologies, I must have grabbed the wrong one.\"\n\nShe swiftly returned the 22 tarot cards to her medium-sized handbag and pulled out a different deck.\n\n\"This is also tarot, but it's from the Minor Arcana. You don't have the privilege to draw from the Major Arcana pack, and I don't have the authority to let you\u2026\"\n\nThe Minor Arcana consisted of 56 cards divided into four suits, each representing chalices, wands, swords, and pentacles.\n\nWhat is she talking about\u2026 Lumian was bewildered by her words.\n\nThis woman was stunningly beautiful and sophisticated, yet there was an air of eccentricity about her that suggested she was not entirely sane.\n\n\"Draw one,\" she urged, waving the Minor Arcana cards in her hand. \"It's complimentary, so there's no cost to try. It may be the solution to your dream predicament.\"\n\nLumian chuckled.\n\n\"My sister once said that free things often come at the most hefty price.\"\n\n\"That may be true,\" the lady said after some thought.\n\nShe laid down the Minor Arcana card with a delicate touch, careful not to upset the glass of Kirsch that sat beside it. \n\n\"But as long as you don't pay, no matter what, how can I, a foreigner, expect to make you pay in Cordu?\"\n\nThat's right\u2026 perhaps it's worth a try. It wasn't easy for me to get a hint about that dream. I gotta give it a shot, but what about the Warlock's curse? Maybe I should get Aurore's help? Lumian's mind raced with conflicting thoughts, and he couldn't decide what to do.\n\nThe woman didn't seem to mind his hesitation.\n\nAfter what seemed like an eternity, Lumian finally made up his mind. Slowly, he leaned forward and reached out his right hand. Carefully, he shuffled through the stack of Minor Arcana cards and extracted one from the middle.\n\n\"Seven of Wands.\" The languid woman's eyes drifted towards the card.\n\nThe image depicted a man in verdant attire, standing atop a mountain with a determined expression on his face. In his hand, he held a wand, poised for battle against the six wands representing his enemies that were attacking from the foot of the mountain.\n\n\"What does this mean?\" Lumian asked.\n\nThe woman's lips curled into a smile.\n\n\"I shall interpret it for you. It symbolizes crisis, challenge, confrontation, courage, et cetera.\n\n\"However, what really matters is that this card now belongs to you. When the time comes, you will discover its true meaning.\"\n\n\"You're giving it to me?\" Lumian's confusion grew with each passing moment.\n\nCould this card truly be cursed?\n\nThe woman ignored his query and started to put away the remaining cards. She picked up her glass and finished the remaining Kirsch in a single gulp. \n\nWith graceful strides, she made her way towards the staircase on the side of Ol' Tavern and ascended to the second floor.\n\nIt was obvious that she lived there.\n\nLumian felt the urge to follow her, but something held him back. His thoughts were in disarray.\n\nIs this really an ordinary card?\n\nShe gave it to me. Does that mean she'll never be able to use that deck again?\n\nAurore might be able to shed some light on this\u2026\n\nAt this moment, Reimund approached Lumian.\n\n\"What's the matter, my friend?\"\n\n\"Nothing much. That foreigner was quite the looker, isn't she?\" Lumian said patronizingly.\n\n\"I reckon your sister, Aurore, is far more beautiful.\" Reimund then lowered his voice. \"Lumian, my p\u00e9p\u00e9 has been gone for ages. What should we do next?\"\n\nLumian, who was in a hurry to leave, pondered for a moment before answering, \n\n\"Firstly, we could track down an elder around your p\u00e9p\u00e9's age who's still kicking. Alternatively, we could head to the cathedral and examine the registry. Uh, but that's something to consider at a later time.\"\n\nLumian remembered his recent altercation with the padre and decided it was better to avoid the cathedral, unless it was absolutely necessary.\n\nAs the only cathedral in Cordu, it held significant power, even acting as a government entity. It recorded all significant events, including deaths, and marriages.\n\nBefore Reimund could ask any further, Lumian interjected, \"Let's split up and see who fits the bill. We'll inquire tomorrow.\"\n\n\"Agreed.\" Reimund immediately agreed.\n\n...\n\nIn the semi-subterranean two-story building, Aurore listened intently to Lumian's tale, her piercing gaze fixed on the \"Wand\" card in his hand.\n\n\"It's an ordinary card, oui. I detect no malice or enchantments.\"\n\n\"Aurore, uh, Grande Soeur, what do you make of the foreigner's intentions? How did she know of my dream?\" Lumian asked.\n\nAurore shook her head.\n\n\"Now that she has shown us her hand, we can only wait and see.\"\n\n\"I will keep a watchful eye on her for the next few days.\n\n\"Oh\u2026 And take this card. It may cause change. But have no fear, I will be watching.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Lumian tried his best to relax.\n\n...\n\nIn the dead of the night, Lumian deftly tucked the Wand card into the garments draping over the back of the chair, then slipped under the covers and shut his eyes.\n\nBefore long, a dense, ashen mist once again enveloped his vision.\n\nWithout warning, he jolted awake within his reverie.\n\nHe sensed his mind clearing, and a newfound lucidity taking hold.\n\nYet, the dreamworld swathed in that same murky haze lingered on.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 29": "Lumian lingered atop the roof, reluctant to descend just yet. \n\nHis visage was a picture of stoicism, betraying no emotion. Gone was the mischievous young man who frequented the tavern, always ready with a grin and a jest. In his place was a composed and resolute figure, unrecognizable to those who knew him before.\n\nSince discovering Aurore's magical powers by chance, Lumian had been obsessed with obtaining them. But Aurore always warned him against it, citing the immense danger and agony that came with wielding such abilities. She refused to divulge the secret even if she knew how to grant them to mere mortals.\n\nLumian couldn't force her to reveal the method, so he resorted to pleading and persuading her at every turn.\n\nAfter a few seconds of contemplation, Lumian sprang to his feet and made his way down to the edge of the roof. He climbed back to the second floor using the wooden ladder.\n\nHe strolled to Aurore's room, only to find the brown wooden door ajar before peeking inside.\n\nAurore sat at her desk, scribbling away with a champagne fountain pen, dressed in a sky-blue gown. \n\nWhat is she writing so late into the night? Is it related to witchcraft? Lumian placed his hand on the door and quipped, \"Writing in your diary, are you?\"\n\n\"Who writes in a diary, honestly?\" Aurore replied without looking up from her writing.\n\nLumian wasn't satisfied with her answer. \n\n\"But didn't Emperor Roselle keep several volumes of diaries?\"\n\nRoselle, the last emperor of the Intis Republic where the siblings currently lived, had brought down the Sauron dynasty and assumed the mantle of Caesar, thereby declaring himself emperor.\n\nThe man had made countless strides in the fields of science and engineering, having been credited with inventing the steam engine. Not to mention, he had charted the sea route to the Southern Continent and sparked an age of colonization. He was the embodiment of his time, a symbol of a bygone era over a century ago.\n\nHowever, in his twilight years, he was double-crossed and assassinated in the White Maple Palace of Trier.\n\nIn the aftermath of his death, his diary pages were disseminated throughout the world, yet they were written in a tongue that nobody could decipher, as if the words didn't exist in this world.\n\n\"That's why Roselle ain't no honest man,\" Aurore, her back turned to Lumian, scoffed.\n\n\"So, what're you scribbling there?\" Lumian queried.\n\nThat was the crux of the matter.\n\nAurore responded with a shrug, her voice dripping with indifference, \"A letter.\"\n\n\"To whom?\" Lumian couldn't help but scowl.\n\nAurore paused, laying down her exquisite golden champagne fountain pen, intricately patterned, to review her words and phrases.\n\n\"A pen pal.\"\n\n\"A what now?\" Lumian furrowed his brow, thoroughly perplexed.\n\nWhat the hell was that?\n\nAurore chuckled, running her fingers through her lustrous golden hair as she began to enlighten her brother.\n\n\"That's why I keep telling you to read more and study more. Quit wasting your days drinking and carousing!\n\n\"Look at you. What sets you apart from an illiterate?\"\n\n\"Pen pals are friends who become acquainted through newspapers, magazines, and other publications. They've never met and rely solely on letters to keep in touch.\"\n\n\"What's the point of having such a friend?\" Lumian asked, rather concerned about this matter.\n\nAs he withdrew his hand from the door, he scratched his chin, deep in thought. \n\nAurore had never had a boyfriend before, so he couldn't allow her to be fooled by someone she had never met before. \n\n\"Meaning?\" Aurore thought about it seriously. \"First off, emotional value. Oui, I know you don't understand the concept. Humans need to connect with one another, but some things and emotions cannot be shared with the villagers, nor with you. I require a more private outlet to release my thoughts. These pen pals, whom I have not met in person, are perfect for that. Secondly, do not underestimate my pen pals. Some of them hold great power, and some possess extensive knowledge. For example, a pen pal gifted me this battery-operated lamp. Kerosene lamps and candles are too damaging to the eyes and not ideal for writing at night\u2026\"\n\nWithout waiting for Lumian to ask another question, Aurore waved her hand behind her. \n\n\"Get some rest, my inebriated brother! Bonne nuit!\"\n\n\"Alright, bonne nuit.\" Lumian replied, trying to hide his frustration.\n\nAurore instructed, \"Don't forget to close the door. It's positively frigid in here with all the windows and the door open like this.\" \n\nLumian slowly shut the door made of brown wood, then headed to his room where he removed his shoes before sitting on the bed.\n\nIn the dimness of the night, Lumian could make out the wooden table beside the window, the slanted chair, the small bookshelf against the wall, and the wardrobe on the other side. \n\nHe sat still, lost in thought.\n\nHe knew Aurore was a woman who kept her secrets to herself, and there were things she had not revealed to him. Lumian was not surprised, but he was worried that her secrets might put her in danger. \n\nAnd when reality hit, his options were limited.\n\nHe was just an ordinary person, with a robust body and a sharp wit.\n\nThoughts came rushing in like waves crashing on the shore, and just as quickly they receded. Lumian took a deep breath and made his way to the washroom to freshen up.\n\nAfterward, he removed his jacket-style brown coat and collapsed onto the cold bed.\n\nThe April air in the mountains was still nippy.\n\n......\n\nIn the midst of his fugue state, Lumian perceived a murky mist, enveloping his surroundings and erasing everything in sight. \n\nHe trudged through the haze in a daze, yet regardless of which direction he took or how far he went, the fog always led him back to the same place\u2014his bedroom.\n\nThe room was fashioned with a white four-piece bed, a wooden table and chair poised in front of the window, bookshelves, wardrobes, and the like.\n\n......\n\nPhew. Lumian's eyes flickered open with a start, the morning sun casting a light through the thin blue curtains. \n\nHe sat up, staring blankly at the room, feeling as if he was still trapped in a dream. \n\nThe same dream he had been having for days\u2014the gray fog that refused to clear.\n\nHe raised a hand to his temples and muttered to himself in a deep voice, \"It's getting more frequent. I have the same dream almost every day\u2026\"\n\nLumian's calm demeanor belied the fact that this dream hadn't brought about any negative effects, but it certainly had also failed to yield any positive outcomes.\n\n\"I pray that hidden in this is something propitious,\" Lumian murmured, as he rose from the bed.\n\nLumian opened the door to the corridor and was immediately met with a sound emanating from Aurore's room. \n\nWhat a coincidence\u2026 Lumian smiled.\n\nBut then, a sudden thought hit him, causing him to take a step back and stand at the edge of the door. \n\nWhen Aurore's bedroom door creaked open, Lumian quickly raised his right hand and began to massage his temples with a slightly pained expression on his face.\n\n\"What's wrong?\" Aurore noticed his discomfort.\n\nSuccess! Lumian cheered inwardly as he tried his best to calm himself down.\n\n\"I had that dream again,\" he replied in a deep voice.\n\nAurore's golden locks of hair cascaded down her shoulders as she furrowed her brows with concern. \n\n\"The previous method didn't work\u2026\" she murmured to herself before suggesting, \n\n\"Perhaps\u2026 I should find you a hypnotist, a real Hypnotist, and see what caused it.\"\n\n\"The kind with magical powers?\" Lumian questioned deliberately.\n\nAurore nodded lightly in response.\n\n\"One of your pen pals?\" Lumian couldn't help but ask.\n\n\"Why do you care about this? Think about how to solve your own problem!\" Aurore retorted without hesitation.\n\nIsn't that what's on my mind? Lumian muttered inwardly.\n\nHe took the opportunity to say, \"Aurore, if I become a Warlock and gain extraordinary powers, I should be able to unlock the secret of the dream and end it completely.\"\n\n\"Don't even think about it!\" Aurore replied without hesitation.\n\nHer expression softened as she continued, \"Lumian, I won't lie to you. This path we're taking is dangerous, painful, and downright treacherous. If I had any other choice and if the world wasn't spiraling out of control, I'd be content with being a regular old writer and living a peaceful life.\"\n\nLumian didn't hesitate to interject, \"Then let me shoulder the burden of danger and pain. I'll protect you, while you do what you love.\"\n\nThose words had been repeating in his head for quite some time.\n\nAurore went quiet for a couple of seconds before a grin spread across her face.\n\n\"Are you discriminating against women?\"\n\nBefore Lumian could say a word, she added with a serious tone, \"It's too late to turn back now. Ain't no going back to what we had before.\n\n\"Fine, I get it. I'm gonna go wash up. You study hard at home today and get ready for the college entrance exams in June!\"\n\n\"You said it yourself, the world is getting more dangerous. What's the point of taking exams?\" Lumian muttered.\n\nHe believed that the key to success was strength, not some paper degree.\n\nAurore just smiled and said, \"Knowledge is power, my uneducated brother.\"\n\nLumian had no response, so he just watched Aurore walk into the washroom.\n\n......\n\nIn the afternoon, in the bustling townsquare of Cordu, \n\nReimund Greg caught sight of Lumian Lee crouched under an elm tree. His thoughts were shrouded in mystery.\n\n\"Shouldn't you be holed up at home with your nose buried in those books?\" Reimund approached him, his voice dripping with envy.\n\nReimund was Lumian's confidant, standing at a moderate 1.7 meters, with brown hair and brown eyes. He was an ordinary-looking fellow with a slightly flushed complexion.\n\nLumian looked up at him and offered a charming grin.\n\n\"Did Aurore not fill you in? Even the hangman deserves a respite! I've been cooped up for so long, I needed a break.\"\n\nAll morning, he had been ruminating on the possibility of acquiring extraordinary powers without Aurore's assistance.\n\nThis required him to seek out clues and take the initiative to investigate.\n\nEventually, he felt that the rumors of magical powers circulating throughout the village held some truth and leads, so he purposely waited for Reimund here.\n\n\"If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't rest for more than fifteen minutes,\" Reimund drawled, leaning casually against the elm tree. \"We don't have a sister who's well-read enough to teach us. I plan on learning how to herd sheep next year.\"\n\nLumian paid no attention to Reimund's remarks and spoke reflectively.\n\n\"Recall the tale of the Warlock for me.\"\n\nReimund couldn't quite understand Lumian's intentions, furrowing his brow in confusion.\n\n\"The one about the Warlock?\"\n\n\"In the past, there was a Warlock in our village, but he died later. On the day of his burial, an owl flew in from outside and perched atop his bed. It only departed after the coffin was carried out.\n\n\"Then, the coffin became unbearably heavy. It took nine bulls to pull it.\"\n\nLumian pressed further, \"How long ago was this?\"\n\nReimund's expression grew increasingly perplexed.\n\n\"How should I know? I heard it from my father.\"\n\n",
        "Chapter: 28": "Lumian sprang to his feet, his eyes flashing with determination. \"Then let's go to your father.\"\n\nHe had always been a man of action, and he knew that investigating the village legend couldn't wait. If he dallied, his sister Aurore would surely catch wind of it, and she would never allow him to proceed.\n\nIn Aurore's eyes, delving into the realm of extraordinary powers was tantamount to playing with fire. \n\nHow can I not know that there's danger? Aurore wouldn't lie to me about this. But even if the world is ablaze, I have to keep walking. I can't let Aurore face this alone\u2026 As he got up, this thought flashed across Lumian's mind.\n\nEvery time Aurore mentioned that the world was becoming more dangerous, the seriousness and worry on her face couldn't be any more genuine! \n\nReimund Greg looked at Lumian with confusion etched on his face. \n\n\"Why are you looking for him?\"\n\nLumian fixed him with a withering look. \"Ask him how long ago the legend of the Warlock took place.\"\n\nWhy is this guy struggling to comprehend such a simple matter? Perhaps I need to find some time to test his intelligence.\n\nReimund still looked baffled as he gazed at Lumian.\n\n\"Why do you need to know such details?\"\n\nUh\u2026 Should I bother trying to explain it to this clueless fellow? Or should I simply come up with a plausible excuse? He weighed his options.\n\nLumian's mind raced as he considered his next move. He knew that he couldn't keep his investigations a secret from his friends, but he also knew that pursuing the truth about the legend was a risky move. However, he quickly came up with an idea.\n\nHe flashed a grin that he usually reserved for moments when he was about to deceive someone.\n\n\"\u2026\" Reimund took two steps back, sensing that something was amiss. \"Spill it!\"\n\nLumian adjusted his dark-colored shirt and linen jacket before smiling. \n\n\"I believe the legend of the Warlock is worthy of our attention.\"\n\n\"What's so important about it?\" Reimund asked after some thought.\n\n\"There was indeed a Warlock in our very village of Cordu in the past,\" Lumian said with a serious expression. \"Think about it, my friend. When I lie, I don't provide specific details like the time, place, and background that anyone could easily verify. However, this legend mentions a Warlock who lived in Cordu, and if it were a fabrication, it would be too easy for someone to expose it as such.\"\n\n\"But that was ages ago,\" Reimund countered.\n\n\"I'm also referring to the people who were around when the legend first started circulating,\" Lumian explained, his smile widening. \"They could have easily confirmed whether or not a Warlock lived in Cordu at that time. And since the legend has been passed down through generations, it's highly likely that it's based on a real event.\"\n\nReimund remained unconvinced.\n\n\"But when you make up stories, you often use phrases like 'more than a hundred years ago,' 'centuries ago,' 'long, long ago,' to make it impossible for anyone to verify.\"\n\n\"That's precisely why I need to confirm it with your father,\" Lumian replied, a sly look in his eye that said: \"You see where I'm going with this, don't you?\"\n\n\"That's true\u2026\" Reimund nodded slowly, accepting Lumian's explanation, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.\n\nAs they left the square and delved deeper into the village, Reimund had a sudden epiphany.\n\n\"Mon Dieu, why do you want to confirm if such a legend is true?\"\n\n\"Warlock, mon ami, that's what we're searching for! If we can confirm the house where he lived and the place where he was buried, we might uncover his secret and gain magical powers that go beyond mere mortals,\" Lumian replied, his truthful words dripping with deceit.\n\nReimund's expression turned skeptical: \"Don't tell me lies.\"\n\n\"Mon ami, most of those tales are created to scare little children. How can they be true? \n\n\"And on top of that, anyone who seeks the power of a Warlock will end up in the Inquisition!\"\n\nThe Intis Republic lay on the Northern Continent, where the orthodox deities were the Eternal Blazing Sun and the God of Steam and Machinery. These two churches divided the faith of almost all the people, and they didn't allow the Church of Evernight Goddess, the Church of the Lord of Storms from the Loen Kingdom, the Church of Earth Mother from the Feynapotter Kingdom, the Church of the God of Knowledge and Wisdom from Lenburg, and the Church of the God of Combat from the Feysac Empire to come in and preach.\n\nThe Eternal Blazing Sun Church's Inquisition was feared by all. Countless heretics had been locked up and subjected to unimaginable torture.\n\nLumian laughed.\n\n\"Why are you fretting now, my friend? You said it yourself, most of those legends are false. The chances of finding a Warlock's remains are slim to none.\n\n\"Besides, even if we do stumble upon the remains of a Warlock, we don't have to take on his forbidden power. We can give it to the Church and get a handsome reward. Oh right, a Warlock's grave is sure to be overflowing with treasures.\"\n\nThe Church that Lumian spoke of was the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun. The Church of the God of Steam and Machinery wasn't found in Cordu, instead it was usually located in large cities and places with factories.\n\nSeeing the temptation growing in Reimund's eyes, Lumian couldn't help but click his tongue in satisfaction. \n\n\"Do you really want to be a shepherd, my friend?\"\n\nThe 'shepherd' he was not talking about the romanticized idea of a pastoral shepherd that city dwellers often had. No, this was a profession. Every morning, they would have to lead a flock of sheep out to graze and watch over them.\n\nCordu was located in Dari\u00e8ge, Riston Province. Being a shepherd was a profession here, a tough and lonely profession. \n\nThey worked for sheep owners, herding dozens, even hundreds of sheep back and forth between the mountains and plains.\n\nThis was known as a herding. Every autumn, the mountains around Cordu would wither, and the shepherds would lead the sheep out of the mountain pass to the warmer plains far away, sometimes crossing borders into Feynapotter, Lenburg, and other countries. By the beginning of May, they would have brought the sheep back to various villages to shear them and wean the lambs. In June, they would trek up the mountains and into the tall ranges. They'd live in shacks and make cheese while grazing the sheep until the weather turned cold.\n\nThe shepherds spent their entire lives on the move, traveling from place to place. They only had a small window to return to the village, which made starting a family nearly impossible. Most of them were single, and the few widows who had no choice but to herd sheep for a living were highly sought after by the shepherds.\n\nReimund fell silent.\n\nAfter a long while, he hesitantly said, \"I'll listen to ya. It does sound like fun, and I could use somethin' to pass the time.\"\n\nIn the ordinary course of events, once the family decided which child would become a shepherd, they would dispatch him to a certain shepherd's location to assist between the ages of fifteen to eighteen. There, he would learn the ropes of shepherding. Three years later, the youngster would officially become a shepherd and seek employment elsewhere.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Reimund, however, had found several reasons to postpone this matter for over two years. If his circumstances did not alter, he would have to start learning how to herd next year.\n\n\"Come on,\" Lumian said, patting Reimund's shoulder. \"Is your father in the fields or at home?\"\n\n\"Recently, there hasn't been much work. Lent is approaching swiftly. He's either at home or at the tavern.\" Reimund let out a voice of envy. \"You don't know anything about this? You're definitely not a farmer. You have a fortunate sister!\"\n\nLumian put his hands in his pockets and sauntered ahead, disregarding Reimund's lamentations.\n\nAs they approached the rundown tavern in the village, a person emerged from the side street.\n\nThis individual was dressed in a lengthy dark brown coat with a hood. A rope was tied around his waist, and he wore a pair of brand-new, supple black leather shoes.\n\n\"Pierre? Pierre of the Berrys?\" Reimund cried out in surprise.\n\nLumian halted in his tracks and turned to look. \n\n\"That's me,\" Pierre Berry replied with a wide grin and a wave of his hand.\n\nHe was a scrawny man with sunken eyes and greasy, curly hair. His stubble suggested it had been quite some time since he last shaved. \n\n\"Why are you back?\" Reimund asked in confusion.\n\nPierre Berry was a shepherd and it was only the beginning of April. He should be tending to his sheep in the fields beyond the mountain pass. How in the world did he find himself in the village?\n\nHe had only just begun his journey, and even if he had gone to Lenburg or the north of Feynapotter, it would take him a month to return to the Dari\u00e8ge mountains.\n\nWith his warm, smiling blue eyes, Pierre exclaimed joyfully, \"Isn't it almost Lent? I haven't celebrated it for years. I can't miss it this year!\"\n\n\"Don't you worry. I have a companion to help me look after the sheep. That's the beauty of being a shepherd. Without a supervisor, as long as I can find someone to help me, I can go wherever I please. I'm free as a bird.\"\n\nLent was a widely celebrated festival throughout Intis. People welcomed the arrival of spring in different ways and prayed for a fruitful harvest for the year.\n\nAlthough it had nothing to do with the Church of the Eternal Blazing Sun or the Church of the God of Steam and Machinery, it had already turned into folklore and didn't involve the worship of pagan deities. Therefore, it had gained the tacit approval of the orthodox factions.\n\n\"You want to see who'll be chosen as the Spring Elf this year, don't you?\" Lumian teased, flashing a grin.\n\nIn Cordu, the people selected a gorgeous girl to play the role of the Spring Elf for Lent. It was all part of the celebration.\n\nPierre laughed along.\n\n\"I hope it's your sister Aurore, but she definitely won't agree, and she's not the right age either.\"\n\n\"Alright,\" he said, pointing towards the tavern just a stone's throw away. \"I'll head to the cathedral to pray. Drinks on me later.\"\n\nReimund absentmindedly replied, \"No need. You don't have much dough.\"\n\n\"Haha, as the good Lord Himself has said, 'Even if there's only one coin de cuivre, we have to share it with our fr\u00e8res pauvres.'\" He recited an adage that was well-known among the shepherds in the Dari\u00e8ge region.\n\nLumian beamed at Reimund, saying, \"Pierre's loaded. He's definitely treating us to a drink!\"\n\nHe pointed to Pierre Berry's spanking new leather shoes.\n\nPierre Berry was thrilled. \n\n\"My new boss is not too shabby. He gave me a few sheep and some wool, cheese, and leather.\"\n\nThe shepherds were compensated with food, a small sum of money, and communal animals, cheese, wool, and leather. The amount they received was dependent on the agreement they had signed with their employer.\n\nFor shepherds who had to travel long distances, having a good and suitable pair of leather shoes was the most pressing and practical desire.\n\nAs Lumian watched Pierre Berry strut towards the town square, his gaze gradually became solemn and filled with suspicion.\n\nHe silently muttered to himself, Going away for a week or two or maybe even a month just to attend Lent?\n\nLumian paused for a moment, his eyes scanning the area before he turned and strode towards the local watering hole with Reimund.\n\nThe tavern was a nondescript establishment with no fancy moniker to speak of. The townsfolk affectionately referred to it as Ol' Tavern.\n\nUpon entering, Lumian's eyes darted around the room in their habitual manner. \n\nSuddenly, his gaze came to a halt.\n\nThere, before him, was the foreigner who had departed so hastily the night before.\n\nShe was alone, not in the company of Ryan, Leah, and Valentine.\n\nHer dress was a long, flowing orange garment, and her locks were a rich brown, tousled in gentle curls. Her piercing, sky-blue eyes were fixed on the scarlet-hued drink that graced her delicate hand.\n\nBeautiful and elegant, she seemed out of place in the seedy, dimly lit tavern.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 30": "Despite feeling the usual pinch, Lumian didn't stop his sister as Ava, Reimund, and the others turned around and walked towards the nearby buildings. He deliberately fell behind and whispered to Aurore, \"Call me if you hear back from Novel Weekly.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I'll keep you updated,\" Aurore replied, giving Lumian a reassuring look.\n\nThe festive and joyous blessing tour continued with songs as they knocked on the villagers' doors in Cordu. \n\nFinally, they arrived at the administrator's residence, which was modified from a castle from the Sauron royal era. It was located on a hill at the edge of Cordu, dark in color with two towering towers. \n\nThe outer walls surrounding the building had long been torn down. Lumian and company passed through the garden specially created by the B\u00e9ost couple and arrived at the entrance.\n\nThe door was four to five meters tall, a brownish-green color like trees, and looked very heavy. \n\nHowever, it was divided into upper and lower parts and only needed to open the two-meter-tall part below unless welcoming esteemed guests.\n\nThe Spring Elf was the embodiment of spring and the messenger of the harvest, so she deserved the most honorable treatment. At this moment, the heavy door was completely opened, and Madame Pualis stood there in a light green corset. \n\nHer lady's maid, Cathy, stood to the side with a basket woven from tree branches, half a step behind.\n\nAva walked over and sang a song of blessings.\n\nMadame Pualis listened quietly with a smile on her face, which made her look noble and reserved. The young men who followed the Spring Elf didn't dare to look at her, but Lumian, who had \"listened\" to the other party and the padre doing the deed, scoffed inwardly when he saw this.\n\nAs the song ended, Ava exchanged the seeds of a tree for a basket of eggs. \n\nThe blessing tour was over, and Lumian, Reimund, and the other lads escorted Ava, the Spring Elf, to the mountain river not far from the village for the second segment of Lent: the waterside ritual.\n\nArriving at the place where geese were usually herded, Ava approached the clear river and did a simple dance, repeating the song from before. Meanwhile, Lumian and the other lads stood still, seven to eight meters away from the Spring Elf.\n\nAfter the dance, Ava took out a chopped turnip from a basket beside her feet, given by a particular villager, and threw it into the river. \n\nAs she threw, she sang, \"A bumper harvest! A bumper harvest!\"\n\nWhen Ava was done, Lumian stepped on the ground and ran over in a few steps. He bent down and took out the cut turnips from the basket and threw them into the river.\n\n\"A bumper harvest! A bumper harvest!\" he shouted.\n\nThe remaining lads were a tad slower than Lumian, but they rushed towards Ava, afraid of falling behind. They took out turnips and radishes from the basket and threw them at different parts of the river while shouting \"bumper harvest.\"\n\nReimund failed to take the initiative and couldn't beat the others, so he was the last to complete the ritual. \n\nThe next second, he saw the malicious smiles of Lumian, Guillaume-junior, and the others. \n\nThey lifted Reimund up, shouting \"bumper harvest,\" and threw him into the water with a splash. Reimund was drenched from head to toe.\n\nThe people on the shore even picked up soil and branches and threw them at him. \n\nThis was part of the waterside ritual: the person who completed the last prayer would be thrown into the river and not allowed to go ashore. They could only swim a little further down and quietly return home to hide until it was dark.\n\nReimund wiped the water droplets off his face and struggled for a few seconds before heading downstream. \n\nOnly then did the team escort Ava to the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedral at the edge of Cordu's square.\n\nIt was almost noon. Most of the villagers, including Lumian's sister Aurore, had gathered at the cathedral, which was not as grand as those in the city. The tallest one was only 11 to 12 meters, with a dome in an arc that looked like an onion from the outside. Looking up from the inside, a dazzling sun mural greeted their eyes.\n\nThe entire cathedral was golden in color and looked very bright, which was also the common style of all the Eternal Blazing Sun cathedrals. \n\nThe altar was located in the east, and all kinds of Sun Flowers surrounded a huge Sacred Emblem. \n\nOn the surface of the Sacred Emblem, the golden ball and the lines representing light formed a symbol filled with mysticism: the symbol of the Eternal Blazing Sun.\n\nHigh up on the wall behind the altar, there were two pure glass windows inlaid with gold foil. Every day, when the sun rose, the light would shine from here onto the Sacred Emblem. \n\nOn the west side of the cathedral, there were two similar glass windows to take in the glow of the setting sun.\n\nAs this was not a formal ritual of the Church but a traditional celebration of the people, Padre Guillaume B\u00e9net did not appear. Instead, Administrator B\u00e9ost hosted the celebration with Ava, who was still dressed as a \"Spring Elf,\" standing next to him. Musical instruments such as flutes and lyres sounded, and the villagers sang songs that praised spring and prayed for a bumper harvest. \n\nThey hadn't rehearsed, so the singing wasn't uniform, and some people even sang and danced, making the scene lively.\n\nLumian's mouth opened and closed, but he didn't make a sound\u2014he was simply going through the motions. On the other hand, Aurore, who was beside him, was engrossed in her singing, taking the opportunity to have fun and raise her voice.\n\nAs he was only going through the motions, Lumian had time to look around. \n\nHe didn't notice any abnormalities in the villagers' behavior. He subconsciously looked up at the golden sun mural on the dome.\n\nThen he saw it\u2014the thing he couldn't quite put his finger on.\n\nThe villagers weren't praising the sun.\n\nFor a village that worshiped the Eternal Blazing Sun, this was strange. Words like \"Praise the Sun\" and \"My God, my Father\" were staples of daily life, but Lumian realized he hadn't heard them in a while!\n\nAs a quasi-believer and having skipped activities in the cathedral since crossing the padre, Lumian hadn't thought much of it before. But something about the solemn and golden atmosphere of the cathedral made him realize that this was not normal.\n\nAnd then he remembered the letter of help that he had reconstructed, the urgent plea for assistance from someone in the village: \"We need help as soon as possible. The people around us are getting weirder.\"\n\nThe people around us are getting weirder\u2026 At that moment, Lumian gained a deeper understanding and agreement with this sentence.\n\nLumian's heart raced as he looked around, searching for Leah and the other foreigners. \n\nBut they were nowhere to be found at this Lenten celebration. \n\nSeriously, they don't appear when they're needed\u2026 Lumian muttered inwardly.\n\nLumian forced himself to join in the chorus, pretending not to notice anything out of the ordinary. \n\nFinally, the singing died down, and the celebration ended. Lumian whispered to Aurore, his voice urgent, \"Go home first. I have something to tell you later.\"\n\nHe knew he couldn't leave yet; as an escort for the Spring Elf, he had to participate in the final part of the ritual.\n\nHe couldn't force his way out of the cathedral, risking an anomalous eruption. \n\nAurore nodded thoughtfully. \"Okay.\"\n\nShe didn't ask further and left the cathedral with Madame Pualis and the other villagers, leaving Lumian behind. \n\nThe cathedral was empty, save for Lumian and a handful of lads who had participated in the blessing tour. \n\nAva, the embodiment of the Spring Elf, stood in the center of the room, surrounded by the contributions, symbolic items that hadn't been thrown into the river\u2014herbs, axes, shovels, whips, and goose sticks.\n\nLumian and his companions had to wait for someone to come in from outside and announce the departure of the Spring Elf before they could take off her crown, necklace, branches, and leaves. During this process, they needed to leave a gap for the Spring Elf to leave Ava's body.\n\nIn just 20 to 30 seconds, footsteps echoed from the cathedral's entrance.\n\nLumian instinctively looked up. Two figures entered the cathedral. \n\nThe thin Shepherd Pierre Berry had rushed back to attend Lent. His eyes were sunken, and he wore a dark brown long coat with a hood. He had tied a rope around his waist and was sporting new black leather shoes. \n\nBut what caught Lumian's attention was that his greasy black hair was now clean and smooth. Even his messy beard had been tidied, and it was now neater and shorter than before. As usual, there was a faint smile in his blue eyes.\n\nThe other man was Padre Guillaume B\u00e9net, adorned in a white robe with gold threads, befitting of his role as a clergyman. He had sparse black hair and a slightly hooked nose, but he exuded a dignified aura. Despite standing at less than 1.7 meters tall, he still seemed to tower over Shepherd Pierre Berry.\n\nThe padre\u2026 Why did he come? Lumian was surprised and puzzled.\n\nAs a clergyman of the Eternal Blazing Sun Church, he had no business being here, at a folk celebration that didn't include a segment to praise the sun.\n\nLumian's mind jolted as he recognized that the padre and his group were previously up to something sinister, especially considering his past conflict with them. He quickly retreated to the side of the stained glass, moving slowly and silently to avoid drawing attention to himself.\n\nThe group hadn't yet surrounded Ava, the Spring Elf, so they were standing in different places, making Lumian's actions inconspicuous.\n\nAva was surprised to see the padre, but she quickly remembered his importance in the village. It made sense for him to announce the end of the Lent celebration. She smiled once again.\n\nPadre Guillaume B\u00e9net and Shepherd Pierre Berry approached Ava, and the former spoke in a deep voice.\n\n\"Send the Spring Elf off.\"\n\nOther than Lumian, people rushed forward to surround Ava.\n\n\"Send the Spring Elf off!\" Shepherd Pierre Belly shouted as he bent his back with a smile.\n\nNot good! Lumian's heart raced as he stepped forward, his body reacting before his mind could catch up.\n\nBut it was too late. Shepherd Pierre Berry picked up an axe from the pile of symbolic items, and with a tight grip and a powerful swing, the axe came cleaving down.\n\nBlood spurted from Ava's neck, forming a thick red mist. \n\nThud.\n\nLumian watched in horror as Ava's head fell to the ground and rolled a few times in the blood, finally stopping, head facing up.\n\nShe still had a look of joy in her eyes.\n\nHaving just taken two steps in her direction, Lumian's heart sank. He immediately turned around and turned to flee towards the stained glass.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 31": "The cloth, jars, and eggs that were splattered with blood, along with the sickening stench, failed to elicit a reaction from Padre Guillaume B\u00e9net. He turned his body and locked his gaze on a particular spot in the cathedral, where Lumian's figure was reflected in his blue eyes.\n\nThe color of the padre's eyes shifted, turning so ethereal that they appeared transparent. \n\nLumian was surrounded by complicated silver symbols that coiled around him like small rivers. He ran through an illusory river that was formed from these symbols, with blurry tributaries ahead of him.\n\nGuillaume B\u00e9net reached out his right hand and grabbed a mercury-colored symbol that encircled Lumian.\n\nLumian stomped his right foot, preparing to hurl himself through the stained glass and out of the cathedral. \n\nBut he slipped and couldn't muster enough strength, and his body was sent flying.\n\nWith a loud bang, whoosh, and cracking sound, Lumian shattered the stained glass depicting Saint Sith, but he failed to break through it and instead crashed back into the cathedral. \n\nHis body was covered in cuts, and blood flowed freely.\n\nShepherd Pierre Berry, who had earlier decapitated Ava with an axe, locked onto Lumian.\n\nHis gentle smile belied the ferocity in his blue eyes, as if a seal inside him had been undone, revealing his true nature.\n\nPierre Berry charged at Lumian with the axe, his body seeming to grow taller and stronger with every step.\n\nLumian leaned against the broken stained-glass window, his back facing the ruthless shepherd.\n\nLumian struggled to free himself from the pain of being stabbed as he fell heavily to the ground. As he propped himself up with his hands to roll out of the cathedral, an abnormal sense of danger washed over him.\n\nSomeone's behind me, he realized. Ignoring the pain and blood, he continued pressing down on the broken glass window frame and pretended to roll out, using it as a cover to quickly retract his body and fall back instead of moving forward.\n\nBang!\n\nSuddenly, an axe smashed into the window frame, sending it flying out of the cathedral with a loud bang. \n\nLumian rolled backward, narrowly avoiding Pierre Berry's violent attack as he lunged past his feet.\n\nBut he didn't feel relieved. Pierre Berry had blocked his only escape route, forcing him back into the cathedral. \n\nDespite having read countless novels, Lumian knew he couldn't rely on simply rolling to avoid getting hit. As he brushed past Pierre Berry, he quickly propped himself up with his elbow, exerted strength from his waist, and bounced up.\n\nHe surveyed the scene and realized that, besides Guillaume-junior and a few others, all the lads had lost their minds and turned deranged. \n\nThey ignored Ava's headless corpse and the blood that stained the ground, shouting excitedly, \"Send the Spring Elf off! Send the Spring Elf off!\"\n\nGuillaume-junior and a few others stood in shock, staring at Ava's wide, smiling eyes without moving. \n\nFear, panic, and disbelief etched their faces, as if trapped in an unbreakable nightmare.\n\nPierre Berry loomed over Lumian, appearing taller than the cathedral dome. \n\nHis axe missed, but he quickly retracted it and swung at Lumian again. Lumian deftly dodged the attack and ran off despite not even finding his footing.\n\nThud thud thud!\n\nLumian fully utilized a Hunter's speed and agility as he ran in an arc.\n\nTarget: the padre!\n\nHe knew he had to deal with the leader, no matter how the others attacked him. He put on a fierce stance, determined to either let them allow him to flee or die trying with him.\n\nOnly in this way could a miracle be created in a very unfavorable situation.\n\nShepherd Pierre Berry didn't pursue Lumian. He stood in front of the broken window frame, holding his blood-stained axe and extending his left hand towards Lumian's direction. \n\nThe cathedral plunged into darkness, and Lumian's surroundings grew even more ominous.\n\nSeemingly coming to life, the abyss swayed gently, like a curtain behind which pale-white, pitch-black, and strange arms were poised to strike.\n\nPadre Guillaume B\u00e9net's eyes were nearly transparent, with Lumian's figure submerged in an illusory river formed by shimmering mercury symbols. In front of him, he saw something similar but more surreal, as if representing the future or a tributary.\n\nAfter experimenting, Guillaume B\u00e9net's right hand finally grasped the key pattern formed by multiple symbols. \n\nWith a single move, he could rewrite Lumian's future and render all his efforts futile.\n\nBut suddenly, the padre's eyes froze, and he let out a scream. His eyes shut tightly as blood and turbid tears streamed down his face. \n\nAmidst his scream, his body expanded like a balloon being filled with gas, and his white robe with golden threads cracked under the strain.\n\nHis skin turned nearly transparent, revealing the bizarre mark that had been hidden beneath his clothes.\n\nThe black marks that resembled a seal connected to an indescribable world. The terrifying aura they emitted filled the cathedral, leaving the lads who were still sending off the Spring Elf in a state of extreme terror. They either ran around the offerings, knelt on the ground, or prostrated themselves on the floor, afraid to look up.\n\nGuillaume-junior and a few others fainted from fear, leaving pools of urine and a foul stench.\n\nShepherd Pierre Berry was about to use his mystic arts to grab Lumian when he threw away his axe and knelt on one knee, bowing his head and ceasing all movement.\n\nLumian was the only one who remained unaffected in the entire cathedral.\n\nAlthough he felt an abnormal pain in his head, it was nothing compared to the mysterious voice that had nearly killed him.\n\nHe also felt a burning sensation in his chest, suspecting that the black thorny chain symbol had appeared, along with the bluish-black symbol resembling an eye and worms.\n\nHowever, he had no time to check his physical condition or understand why he suddenly had the upper hand. He continued to run towards Padre Guillaume B\u00e9net, determined not to let any opportunity slip by!\n\nAs he got closer, Lumian could clearly see the unique black marks resembling seals made up of strange symbols and words. \n\nHis gaze quickly swept around and he noticed something familiar: black symbols resembling thorns that drilled out of the left chest of Padre Guillaume Bennet and circled behind him. \n\nIt was identical to Lumian's chest, but much lighter.\n\nHe has one too?\n\nLumian's heart trembled.\n\nIs this the root cause of the abnormality in the village?\n\nWhy do I have it? When did I get it?\n\n\u2026\n\nThoughts quickly surfaced in Lumian's mind, but he didn't let them distract him from his movements. \n\nHe ran towards Guillaume B\u00e9net, stretched out his right arm, and wrapped it around the enemy's head. \n\nWithout pausing, he forcefully circled behind the padre, and with a snap, Guillaume B\u00e9net's head turned and faced his spine.\n\nPhew\u2026 Lumian breathed a sigh of relief, knowing that the biggest problem had been resolved. He had to hurry home and escape with his sister, leaving the rest to the three foreigners to deal with.\n\nBut just as Lumian turned to leave, Guillaume B\u00e9net, who was supposed to be dead, opened his eyes. \n\nThey were bloodshot, and a sharp buzz split Lumian's head in half, the intense pain preventing him from screaming.\n\nEverything shattered before his eyes, and he was engulfed in darkness as he lost consciousness.\n\n......\n\nPainful!\n\nHow painful!\n\nLumian suddenly sat up, opened his eyes, and rubbed his head.\n\nHe saw the familiar surroundings of his bedroom: the wooden table, the reclining chair, and the wardrobe and small bookshelves on both sides. \n\nI was saved by Grande Soeur? How long was I out? How is the situation in the cathedral? Lumian didn't have the time to think through it. Without wasting any time, Lumian got off the bed, held his head, and rushed out.\n\nHe found Aurore in the kitchen on the first floor, wearing a light blue dress and preparing dinner. \n\nLumian shouted, \"Aurore! Grande Soeur, we need to run! The padre and many people in the village have gone crazy. They killed Ava at the end of the celebration!\"\n\nHe wasn't sure if his sister knew about the incident, so he got straight to the point. After all, there were many ways to be saved, and it did not mean that she had to be at the scene. \n\nAurore turned around, looking confused, and asked, \"Celebration? The Lent celebration?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Lumian nodded vigorously.\n\nAurore smiled.\n\n\"That was one hell of a story. Two sentences and you've got me feeling all kinds of scared. But listen, you gotta be more careful with your tales. Lent's still a few days away.\"\n\n\"\u2026\" Lumian was stunned.\n\n",
        "Chapter: 32": "A price is always exacted for what fate bestows\u2014adapted from Zweig's Mary Queen of Scots.\n\n\"I'm a nobody, with no time to notice the brightness of the sun.\n\n\"My parents couldn't help me, and I wasn't highly educated. I had no choice but to make it on my own in the city.\n\n\"I'd applied to many jobs, but no one ever hired me. Maybe it's because I'm not good at expressing myself, and I'm not the best communicator. I guess I just haven't shown enough ability.\n\n\"Once, I'd eaten two loaves of bread over a three-day period. Hunger kept me up at night. At least I paid a month's rent in advance, so I didn't have to face the cold winter wind outside.\n\n\"Finally, I found a job at the hospital's morgue, keeping vigil over the dead.\n\n\"Nighttime in the hospital was colder than I could have ever imagined. The corridor's wall lights were out, leaving everything shrouded in darkness. I could barely see my feet, and the only light seeping out was from the rooms.\n\n\"Mon Dieu, it reeked of something fierce. The smell of death lingered in the air. And from time to time, we had to help move the bodies into the morgue.\n\n\"It wasn't the most glamorous of jobs, but it put bread on the table. Plus, the free time at night allowed me to study. Few people ventured to the morgue, but when they did, they were there delivering bodies or taking them away for cremation. I had to make do without books, as I couldn't afford them, nor did I see any hope of saving up enough for them.\n\n\"But I had to thank my predecessor for leaving so suddenly, as it allowed me to get this job.\n\n\"I dreamed of working the day shift. Sleeping during the day and being awake at night made my body weak and my head throb.\"\n\n\"One day, a new corpse was brought in. \n\n\"From what I'd heard, it's the body of my predecessor who suddenly left.\n\n\"I was intrigued by the mysterious disappearance of my predecessor, and as soon as the others left the room, I pulled out the cabinet and quietly opened the body bag.\n\n\"He was an old man, with bluish-white skin and wrinkles covering his face. The poor lighting only served to make him look scarier.\n\n\"He didn't have much hair. Most of it was white. He had been stripped of his clothes, not even a piece of cloth was left on him.\n\n\"As a dead man without a family, the movers couldn't resist the opportunity to cash in on the guy.\n\n\"I saw a strange mark on his chest. It was bluish-black. I can't really explain it. The light was too dim at the time.\n\n\"I reached out and touched the mark, only to realize there was nothing special about it.\n\n\"Looking at my predecessor, I couldn't help but wonder if I'd end up like him when I grew old\u2026\n\n\"I promised his body I'd be with him on his last journey, take him to the crematorium and then to the nearest free cemetery. I couldn't have the bureaucrats throwing him in the river or some forsaken land like trash.\n\n\"I knew I was gonna 'ave to sacrifice some shut-eye, but Dieu merci it was Sunday the next day. I could catch up on my lost sleep then.\n\n\"After saying that, I zipped up the bag and shoved it back in the cabinet.\n\n\"The room went darker and the shadows lengthened\u2026\n\n\"Since that day, every time I close my eyes, I'm swallowed by a thick fog.\n\n\"Something tells me I'm not alone. Something not quite human is coming my way. But nobody will listen. They think I've lost my mind in this job; they say I need a doctor\u2026\"\n\nA male customer sitting at the bar looked at the narrator who had suddenly stopped and asked, \"And?\"\n\nThe narrator suddenly stopped his tale, causing a male customer at the bar to take notice. This mid-thirties chap sported a drab duffel coat and pale yellow strides. His hair was slicked back, and he had a rough dark bowler hat by his side.\n\nHe seemed run-of-the-mill, like the rest of the punters in the alehouse, with dark locks and piercing blue peepers. Not particularly handsome, but not repugnant either. Nothing about him screamed for attention.\n\nThe narrator was a strapping lad in his late teens, with long limbs and chiseled features that could make any lass go weak in the knees. His short, jet-black hair and bright, blue eyes only added to his appeal.\n\nThe lad looked wistfully at the empty wine glass in front of him and let out a deep sigh.\n\n\"And then?\n\n\"Then I quit my job and returned to the countryside so that I can tell you this bullshit,\" the lad responded with a sly grin spreading across his face.\n\nThe male guest was taken aback.\n\n\"Were you just pulling our leg?\"\n\n\"Haha!\" Laughter erupted around the bar.\n\nHowever, the laughter was short-lived as a middle-aged man looked sternly at the slightly embarrassed customer and remarked, \"You ain't from around here, are ya? Lumian spins a different yarn every day. Yesterday, he was a penniless bloke who got dumped by his fianc\u00e9e, and today, he's a watchman for the dead!\"\n\n\"Aye, he talks about spending thirty years east of the Serenzo River and then thirty years to the right of it. He's full of hot air, that one!\" added another regular at the tavern.\n\nAll the men were farmers from the village of Cordu, wearing drab-colored tunics.\n\nThe black-haired lad, Lumian, leaned forward on the bar counter and rose to his feet. He flashed a cheeky grin and proclaimed, \"As you all know, I ain't the one making this up. My sister pens these tales. She's a writer for some column known as Novel Weekly or other.\"\n\nWith that, Lumian turned around, spread his arms wide, and beamed at the foreign customer. \n\n\"Looks like she's crafted quite the tale.\n\n\"I'm sorry you misunderstood.\"\n\nThe unremarkable man in the brown tweed shirt smiled and stood up.\n\n\"What an intriguing story.\n\n\"And how might I address you?\"\n\n\"Isn't it common courtesy to introduce oneself before inquiring of others?\" Lumian replied, returning the man's smile.\n\nThe foreigner nodded.\n\n\"My name is Ryan Koss.\n\n\"These are my companions, Valentine and Leah.\"\n\nThe last sentence referred to the man and woman sitting beside him.\n\nValentine, a man in his late twenties with powdered blonde hair and piercing blue eyes, wore a white vest, a blue tweed jacket, and black trousers. It was evident that he had put considerable effort into his attire, as if he had been priming himself for a special rendezvous.\n\nHe had a rather chilly look on his face, not even sparing a glance for the farmers and herders around him.\n\nLeah, on the other hand, was a striking young woman with long, light gray hair tied into an elaborate bun and a white veil perched atop her head. \n\nHer eyes matched her hair and she regarded Lumian with an open smile, clearly amused by their exchange.\n\nIn the glow of the gas lamps inside the tavern, the woman named Leah showed off her sharp nose and stunningly curved lips. She was definitely a stunner in the countryside like Cordu.\n\nShe wore a snug white pleated cashmere dress with a small off-white coat and a pair of Marseillan boots. There were two tiny silver bells fastened to her veil and boots. They jingled as she walked into the tavern, drawing the attention of many\u2014especially the men.\n\nIn their eyes, this was the kind of fashionable getup you'd only see in the big cities, like the provincial capital of Bigorre or even the capital city of Trier.\n\nLumian gave a nod of acknowledgement to the three foreigners.\n\n\"The name's Lumian Lee. You may address me as Lumian.\"\n\n\"Lee?\" Leah blurted out.\n\n\"What's the matter? Y'all got a problem with my last name?\" Lumian asked with a curious look on his face.\n\nRyan Koss took it upon himself to explain on Leah's behalf, \"Your last name is downright frightening. I nearly lost control of my voice just now.\"\n\nObserving the bewildered expressions of the farmers and herdsmen around him, he continued, \n\n\"Folks who have crossed paths with sailors and sea merchants are familiar with a saying that's making the rounds in the Five Seas:\n\n\"I'd rather come face to face with pirate Admirals or even kings than run into a bloke named Frank Lee.\n\n\"That person's last name is also Lee.\"\n\n\"Is he really that scary?\" Lumian inquired.\n\nRyan shook his head in response.\n\n\"I'm not exactly sure, but if such a legend exists, then it can't be far from the truth.\"\n\nHe switched topics and said to Lumian, \"Merci for the story. It merits a drink. What do you desire?\"\n\n\"A glass of La F\u00e9e Verte.\" Lumian didn't beat around the bush and settled back into his seat.\n\nRyan Koss furrowed his brow.\n\n\"'La F\u00e9e Verte'\u2026 Absinthe?\"\n\n\"I must remind you, absinthe is harmful to the human body. Such alcohol can lead to insanity and hallucinations.\"\n\n\"I didn't expect the trends of Trier to reach here,\" Leah chimed in with a grin.\n\nLumian acknowledged her comment tersely.\n\n\"So the people of Trier also enjoy La F\u00e9e Verte\u2026\"\n\n\"For us, life is already tough enough. No need to fret over a little more harm. This drink can calm our minds.\"\n\n\"Alright.\" Ryan leaned back in his chair and turned to the bartender. \"A glass of La F\u00e9e Verte and another glass of C\u0153ur \u00c9pic\u00e9.\"\n\nC\u0153ur \u00c9pic\u00e9 was a renowned fruit-based spirit that had been distilled to perfection.\n\nThe thin, middle-aged man who had exposed Lumian's lies piped up. \"Give me a glass of La F\u00e9e Verte too. After all, I was the one who told the truth just now. I can even tell you the truth about this kid's situation!\" He glared at Lumian, daring him to object. \"Foreigner, I can tell you still have your doubts about the authenticity of that story.\"\n\n\"Pierre, you'd do anything for a free glass of alcohol,\" Lumian retorted, scowling.\n\nBefore Ryan could even respond, Lumian added, \"Why can't I tell my story and get an extra glass of La F\u00e9e Verte?\"\n\n\"Because no one knows if they should believe you,\" Pierre smirked. \"Your sister's favorite story to tell kids is 'The Boy Who Cried Wolf.' People who lie all the time lose their credibility eventually.\"\n\nLumian shrugged and watched as the bartender slid a glass of light green alcohol in front of him. \"\u00c7a va,\" he said, unbothered.\n\nRyan turned to Lumian. \n\n\"Is that all right?\"\n\n\"Sure thing, as long as your wallet can handle it,\" Lumian replied breezily.\n\n\"In that case, another glass of La F\u00e9e Verte,\" Ryan said with a nod.\n\nPierre's face lit up with a smile.\n\n\"Generous foreigner, you should steer clear of this one,\" he said, gesturing to Lumian. \"He's the most mischievous bloke in the whole village.\"\n\n\"Five years ago, his sister Aurore brought him back to the village,\" Pierre continued. \"He's been here ever since. Can you imagine? He was just a wee lad of thirteen at the time. How could he have made the trek to the hospital to become a corpse watchman? The nearest hospital is in Dari\u00e8ge at the foot of the mountain. It would take an entire afternoon to get there by foot.\"\n\n\"Brought back to the village?\" Leah inquired, her voice tinged with suspicion.\n\nShe tilted her head, causing her bells to tinkle.\n\nPierre nodded in confirmation.\n\n\"Aurore moved here six years ago. A year later, she went on a journey and brought this lad back with her. Said she found him on the road, a starving, homeless child. She planned to adopt him.\"\n\n\"Then, he took on Aurore's last name, Lee. Even his name, Lumian, was given by Aurore.\"\n\n\"I don't even remember what my name was before Aurore gave me the name,\" Lumian, unfazed by the revelation, flashed a grin and took a sip of absinthe.\n\nIt was clear that his past did not bother him in the slightest.\n\n"
